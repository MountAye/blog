here we go so if you remember the<br>\r\n`(00:52)` lecture so you can see that<br>\r\n`(00:54)` great uh so you remember if you remember<br>\r\n`(00:56)` lecture that we had last time<br>\r\n`(00:59)` uh i gave a little introduction to the<br>\r\n`(01:02)` mathematics that is<br>\r\n`(01:04)` behind the description of the stochastic<br>\r\n`(01:07)` processes<br>\r\n`(01:09)` and we discussed two kinds<br>\r\n`(01:12)` of stochastic processes alternatives not<br>\r\n`(01:15)` two kinds of stochastic processes but<br>\r\n`(01:17)` two ways<br>\r\n`(01:18)` of describing sarcastic processes the<br>\r\n`(01:21)` first way<br>\r\n`(01:22)` that was associated with the name<br>\r\n`(01:24)` nonzero<br>\r\n`(01:25)` that we already featured in the very<br>\r\n`(01:26)` first lecture<br>\r\n`(01:28)` relied on deriving<br>\r\n`(01:32)` a stochastic differential equation that<br>\r\n`(01:34)` describes<br>\r\n`(01:36)` the time evolution of a single<br>\r\n`(01:38)` realization<br>\r\n`(01:39)` of such a stochastic process and the<br>\r\n`(01:41)` alternative approach that einstein<br>\r\n`(01:44)` applied for the description of broad<br>\r\n`(01:46)` emotion<br>\r\n`(01:47)` was to derive an equation<br>\r\n`(01:52)` for the time evolution of the<br>\r\n`(01:54)` probability density<br>\r\n`(01:56)` itself yeah and that was the master<br>\r\n`(01:58)` equation this master equation is not a<br>\r\n`(02:00)` stochastic<br>\r\n`(02:01)` differential equation is a deterministic<br>\r\n`(02:04)` equation<br>\r\n`(02:05)` but it's typically high dimensional and<br>\r\n`(02:09)` relies as you saw last time on some<br>\r\n`(02:13)` integrations over the possible states<br>\r\n`(02:16)` that you can jump into<br>\r\n`(02:18)` and then for those of you who remained<br>\r\n`(02:21)` for the example<br>\r\n`(02:23)` section last time you would have seen<br>\r\n`(02:26)` that these master equations although<br>\r\n`(02:29)` they look<br>\r\n`(02:30)` pretty complicated can be derived<br>\r\n`(02:32)` phenologically<br>\r\n`(02:34)` phenologically actually<br>\r\n`(02:37)` in most cases in a very simple way yeah<br>\r\n`(02:41)` so these are the two kinds of<br>\r\n`(02:42)` description and why are we not<br>\r\n`(02:44)` completely happy with that<br>\r\n`(02:48)` so there exists approximately<br>\r\n`(02:52)` suppose both in general conditions both<br>\r\n`(02:54)` of these different kinds of equations<br>\r\n`(02:55)` cannot be solved<br>\r\n`(02:57)` there exists approximative methods that<br>\r\n`(03:00)` we discussed last time for example the<br>\r\n`(03:01)` focal plunk equation<br>\r\n`(03:03)` that was an approximation for the master<br>\r\n`(03:06)` equation<br>\r\n`(03:07)` and these appropriate approximative<br>\r\n`(03:09)` methods that work in certain special<br>\r\n`(03:11)` cases<br>\r\n`(03:13)` now the focal planck equation as you<br>\r\n`(03:15)` remember the<br>\r\n`(03:16)` derivation relied on making strong<br>\r\n`(03:19)` assumptions<br>\r\n`(03:20)` on how these jumps in states state space<br>\r\n`(03:24)` look like they're very nicely behave<br>\r\n`(03:26)` these jumps are very small<br>\r\n`(03:28)` and that they effectively rely on very<br>\r\n`(03:32)` large<br>\r\n`(03:32)` system size and<br>\r\n`(03:36)` in other cases there are no<br>\r\n`(03:39)` approximative<br>\r\n`(03:40)` methods at all so what field theory<br>\r\n`(03:44)` does for us is it gives us a flexible<br>\r\n`(03:47)` framework a general<br>\r\n`(03:48)` and flexible framework that allows us to<br>\r\n`(03:51)` describe a large class of stochastic<br>\r\n`(03:54)` systems<br>\r\n`(03:55)` and it is even<br>\r\n`(03:59)` maybe if you remember from statistical<br>\r\n`(04:01)` physics or quantum mechanics<br>\r\n`(04:03)` it's uh so general that you can apply it<br>\r\n`(04:06)` to<br>\r\n`(04:06)` a very diverse set of systems that's<br>\r\n`(04:10)` one thing is for example spatially<br>\r\n`(04:12)` extended systems<br>\r\n`(04:13)` yes you can see on the bottom uh right<br>\r\n`(04:16)` yeah so this is a system where<br>\r\n`(04:20)` the evolution over the spatial<br>\r\n`(04:22)` information<br>\r\n`(04:23)` itself is very important not because you<br>\r\n`(04:26)` see here there's a chemical<br>\r\n`(04:28)` system you see that here structures form<br>\r\n`(04:31)` it's an example of what's called binodal<br>\r\n`(04:33)` decomposition<br>\r\n`(04:35)` now so here the spatial component is<br>\r\n`(04:36)` very important<br>\r\n`(04:38)` and this has to be taken into account<br>\r\n`(04:41)` when you want to understand of course<br>\r\n`(04:43)` collective processes<br>\r\n`(04:45)` another example are non-linearities in<br>\r\n`(04:48)` stochastic differential equations<br>\r\n`(04:51)` now these become especially if they<br>\r\n`(04:53)` affect an oyster and become pretty hard<br>\r\n`(04:55)` very quickly<br>\r\n`(04:56)` and another example is that i would have<br>\r\n`(04:58)` showed you last time<br>\r\n`(05:00)` that field theory that typical<br>\r\n`(05:02)` approximative methods like the focal<br>\r\n`(05:04)` planck<br>\r\n`(05:06)` method or other kinds of expansions<br>\r\n`(05:10)` uh are not very suitable for rare events<br>\r\n`(05:14)` for the tales of probability<br>\r\n`(05:16)` distributions<br>\r\n`(05:17)` so in fields here we have a general<br>\r\n`(05:19)` framework<br>\r\n`(05:20)` of understanding these variables<br>\r\n`(05:24)` and so there has been a lot of work on<br>\r\n`(05:26)` how to make approximations to these<br>\r\n`(05:28)` field theories<br>\r\n`(05:30)` that allow us to understand the tales of<br>\r\n`(05:32)` probability distributions and very often<br>\r\n`(05:34)` these tales<br>\r\n`(05:36)` are pretty important so they are not<br>\r\n`(05:39)` they're rare<br>\r\n`(05:40)` but uh if you think about a nuclear<br>\r\n`(05:44)` reactor or something like this yes these<br>\r\n`(05:46)` rare events are rare<br>\r\n`(05:47)` but you want to know how often they hear<br>\r\n`(05:49)` and there are a few theoretic methods<br>\r\n`(05:51)` that allow you<br>\r\n`(05:52)` to calculate the tails of probability<br>\r\n`(05:54)` distributions<br>\r\n`(05:56)` very nicely so<br>\r\n`(06:00)` this is what we'll do and in this<br>\r\n`(06:02)`

i want to show you how we can derive<br>\r\n`(06:07)` a field theory description um<br>\r\n`(06:11)` for the longitudinal equation for<br>\r\n`(06:13)` stochastic differential equations<br>\r\n`(06:15)` we'll be looking at very simple a<br>\r\n`(06:20)` very simple automatic equation that<br>\r\n`(06:22)` doesn't have any<br>\r\n`(06:23)` explicit time derivative that doesn't<br>\r\n`(06:25)` have<br>\r\n`(06:26)` multiplicative noise and we can<br>\r\n`(06:30)` nevertheless in the framework of field<br>\r\n`(06:31)` theory we can<br>\r\n`(06:33)` straightforwardly uh extend<br>\r\n`(06:36)` this methodology to more complicated<br>\r\n`(06:38)` systems so we restrict ourselves<br>\r\n`(06:40)` to this very simple larger equation uh<br>\r\n`(06:43)` with gaussian white noise<br>\r\n`(06:45)` that is as last time uncorrelated<br>\r\n`(06:50)` so if you<br>\r\n`(06:54)` so the first step here is to discretize<br>\r\n`(06:58)` time yeah and uh so we take<br>\r\n`(07:02)` the logical equation and we write it<br>\r\n`(07:03)` down in discrete time<br>\r\n`(07:06)` and uh as you saw uh last time<br>\r\n`(07:09)` uh or in the first of what was the first<br>\r\n`(07:12)` lecture already i saw<br>\r\n`(07:13)` two lectures ago oh wait whatever yeah<br>\r\n`(07:16)` so so no last time last time was the<br>\r\n`(07:18)` catholic processes<br>\r\n`(07:19)` yeah so as you saw last time the way we<br>\r\n`(07:22)` discretize<br>\r\n`(07:24)` stochastic differential equations and i<br>\r\n`(07:27)` showed you that for uh stochastic<br>\r\n`(07:28)` integrals is very important<br>\r\n`(07:32)` yeah and in this case we also have to<br>\r\n`(07:34)` discretize<br>\r\n`(07:35)` our stochastic differential equation in<br>\r\n`(07:37)` a certain way<br>\r\n`(07:39)` which is called the ito discretization<br>\r\n`(07:43)` and but if we do that if we discretize<br>\r\n`(07:47)` our stochastic differential equation in<br>\r\n`(07:49)` this way<br>\r\n`(07:50)` the idea is that in principle we can<br>\r\n`(07:53)` write down<br>\r\n`(07:55)` averages over any<br>\r\n`(07:58)` observable you know that's here on the<br>\r\n`(08:01)` left left hand side by some complicated<br>\r\n`(08:04)` thing that is on the right hand side<br>\r\n`(08:07)` so this what is on the right hand side<br>\r\n`(08:09)` and this equation looks pretty<br>\r\n`(08:10)` complicated but it's not that<br>\r\n`(08:12)` complicated so let's have a look<br>\r\n`(08:14)` at these different terms in the first<br>\r\n`(08:18)` term here<br>\r\n`(08:19)` on the left right hand side the red term<br>\r\n`(08:22)` we just integrate over all possible<br>\r\n`(08:25)` realizations<br>\r\n`(08:27)` that a stochastic trajectory can take<br>\r\n`(08:32)` on the right hand side<br>\r\n`(08:35)` now if you look at the right hand side<br>\r\n`(08:37)` oh there's a delta function missing here<br>\r\n`(08:40)` right at here delta here<br>\r\n`(08:43)` on the right hand side you have this<br>\r\n`(08:45)` delta function<br>\r\n`(08:49)` here you have this delta function and<br>\r\n`(08:52)` this delta function<br>\r\n`(08:54)` just makes sure that whatever we<br>\r\n`(08:56)` integrate here whatever trajectories we<br>\r\n`(08:59)` integrate over<br>\r\n`(09:01)` that they fulfill the discretized<br>\r\n`(09:04)` version<br>\r\n`(09:05)` of the larger equation<br>\r\n`(09:08)` yeah so the delta function is just the<br>\r\n`(09:11)` left-hand side<br>\r\n`(09:12)` minus the right-hand side of this launch<br>\r\n`(09:15)` of our equation<br>\r\n`(09:16)` and if the left-hand side is equal to<br>\r\n`(09:18)` the right-hand side<br>\r\n`(09:20)` then we take that trajectory into<br>\r\n`(09:22)` account<br>\r\n`(09:23)` you know and then sandwiched between<br>\r\n`(09:26)` that we have<br>\r\n`(09:27)` our observable o that is some functional<br>\r\n`(09:31)` of our trajectory x<br>\r\n`(09:34)` now as i say functional so i don't know<br>\r\n`(09:37)` how much uh<br>\r\n`(09:37)` functional analysis all of you had so<br>\r\n`(09:40)` most<br>\r\n`(09:41)` so i would expect that most of you would<br>\r\n`(09:44)` have that<br>\r\n`(09:44)` until the first fourth term<br>\r\n`(09:48)` or so also but just just to make sure a<br>\r\n`(09:51)` functional<br>\r\n`(09:52)` is basically a function that maps um<br>\r\n`(09:56)` that maps this that maps<br>\r\n`(09:59)` this function x uh yes that map<br>\r\n`(10:03)` a function to a real number yeah<br>\r\n`(10:06)` and this is our how we define these<br>\r\n`(10:08)` observables<br>\r\n`(10:09)` now you take a trajectory and you map it<br>\r\n`(10:12)` to them to a number<br>\r\n`(10:16)` okay so this looks very complicated it<br>\r\n`(10:18)` doesn't help us<br>\r\n`(10:19)` anything at all and uh<br>\r\n`(10:22)` one the other step that we need to make<br>\r\n`(10:24)` on the slide is we that we<br>\r\n`(10:26)` introduce some notations here<br>\r\n`(10:29)` and uh of course we don't always want to<br>\r\n`(10:32)` write<br>\r\n`(10:33)` all of these integrals here on the left<br>\r\n`(10:36)` hand side<br>\r\n`(10:37)` we just say we write that in this<br>\r\n`(10:39)` functional form here<br>\r\n`(10:41)` and of course many of you will know that<br>\r\n`(10:43)` this is just<br>\r\n`(10:44)` a functional integral or a path into<br>\r\n`(10:47)` yeah that's how we define it

and now for uh notational convenience<br>\r\n`(10:54)` now we just go to a continuum locate<br>\r\n`(10:56)` notation now we forget that we<br>\r\n`(10:58)` discretize time in the previous step<br>\r\n`(11:01)` and we write the equation back in<br>\r\n`(11:03)` continuous form<br>\r\n`(11:05)` just for the sake of simplicity and we<br>\r\n`(11:07)` define<br>\r\n`(11:08)` some delta functional<br>\r\n`(11:11)` that is just equal to the product over<br>\r\n`(11:14)` all data functions that we had on the<br>\r\n`(11:16)` previous slide<br>\r\n`(11:17)` now if you look here are the product of<br>\r\n`(11:20)` our data functions<br>\r\n`(11:21)` just make sure that you fulfill the<br>\r\n`(11:23)` larger equation really at each time<br>\r\n`(11:25)` point<br>\r\n`(11:27)` and we just define like a super delta<br>\r\n`(11:29)` function or delta functional<br>\r\n`(11:31)` that makes sure that we really satisfy<br>\r\n`(11:33)` the larger equation for each time point<br>\r\n`(11:41)` so now we make a little trick<br>\r\n`(11:45)` now we say we have this delta function<br>\r\n`(11:47)` or this product of delta functions<br>\r\n`(11:50)` and what we say is that in fourier space<br>\r\n`(11:54)` the delta function is represented by a<br>\r\n`(11:58)` plane<br>\r\n`(11:58)` wave yeah so we fully transform the<br>\r\n`(12:02)` delta function<br>\r\n`(12:15)` or a functional is now and<br>\r\n`(12:18)` the fourier transform of the delta<br>\r\n`(12:20)` function<br>\r\n`(12:21)` just becomes delta x dot<br>\r\n`(12:25)` minus f of x minus<br>\r\n`(12:29)` sine because our delta our function<br>\r\n`(12:31)` equation<br>\r\n`(12:33)` is equal to a fury space<br>\r\n`(12:38)` d x tilde<br>\r\n`(12:43)` e to the minus i x to the<br>\r\n`(12:48)` x dot minus<br>\r\n`(12:52)` f of x minus c<br>\r\n`(12:56)` now we now get this variable x tilde<br>\r\n`(13:00)` so this is nothing there's nothing<br>\r\n`(13:01)` happening it's just the definition of<br>\r\n`(13:03)` the forage in the form<br>\r\n`(13:04)` of a delta function and because we have<br>\r\n`(13:08)` this<br>\r\n`(13:08)` product for many delta functions here<br>\r\n`(13:12)` we have the integral here that the path<br>\r\n`(13:15)` integral here will also get a path<br>\r\n`(13:17)` integral<br>\r\n`(13:18)` delta x total you know that's that just<br>\r\n`(13:22)` the definition of the fury transform<br>\r\n`(13:24)` and now we plug this<br>\r\n`(13:28)` in again so<br>\r\n`(13:32)` we obtain from that<br>\r\n`(13:35)` that the expectation value of our<br>\r\n`(13:39)` observable yeah<br>\r\n`(13:43)` taken to the average now this average is<br>\r\n`(13:45)` over the distance<br>\r\n`(13:47)` over over a different voice realizations<br>\r\n`(13:52)` yeah it is equal now we plug that in<br>\r\n`(13:55)` an integral now over<br>\r\n`(13:58)` x and x tilde so it's a path integral<br>\r\n`(14:03)` over x and x tilde so we there's an<br>\r\n`(14:06)` integral<br>\r\n`(14:07)` over all realization of x and all<br>\r\n`(14:10)` realization<br>\r\n`(14:11)` of x2 now so now this x still that pops<br>\r\n`(14:14)` up

here the<br>\r\n`(15:03)` product<br>\r\n`(15:04)` we had here gives us an integral so our<br>\r\n`(15:07)` sum<br>\r\n`(15:08)` in the exponential so this was<br>\r\n`(15:10)` originally like a product of many<br>\r\n`(15:12)` exponential<br>\r\n`(15:14)` and uh so this is this and then we have<br>\r\n`(15:18)` our<br>\r\n`(15:18)` x tilde x dot minus<br>\r\n`(15:23)` f of x minus x psi<br>\r\n`(15:28)` and then we close the average<br>\r\n`(15:32)` and then we just plug this in yeah we<br>\r\n`(15:34)` can move out<br>\r\n`(15:36)` everything that does not depend on psi<br>\r\n`(15:39)` or the noise<br>\r\n`(15:41)` out of the average because average is<br>\r\n`(15:43)` over the noise<br>\r\n`(15:46)` b x x to the<br>\r\n`(15:51)` power of x right now comes the

to some of<br>\r\n`(24:40)` you yet quantum field theory<br>\r\n`(24:42)` this looks very familiar so what we do<br>\r\n`(24:45)` now is<br>\r\n`(24:46)` we want to calculate the average

here<br>\r\n`(25:14)` now and this exponential factor looks<br>\r\n`(25:16)` very much like what you know from<br>\r\n`(25:19)` other field theories like quantum field<br>\r\n`(25:21)` theory and this is why this is very<br>\r\n`(25:23)` often called<br>\r\n`(25:24)` an action<br>\r\n`(25:28)` now that's the martin sutra rose or ms<br>\r\n`(25:31)` rjd functional<br>\r\n`(25:34)` integral that

they don't have<br>\r\n`(25:47)` a space component now they don't have<br>\r\n`(25:49)` spatial dimensions<br>\r\n`(25:51)` but as you can see later the structure<br>\r\n`(25:53)` of a real spatial<br>\r\n`(25:55)` the the integrals they will look very<br>\r\n`(25:58)` similar<br>\r\n`(26:00)` now we can also rewrite this a little<br>\r\n`(26:04)` bit here and look at specific<br>\r\n`(26:05)` trajectories and then we can look for<br>\r\n`(26:09)` example at a special case<br>\r\n`(26:11)` where it is observable is just<br>\r\n`(26:14)` the propagator here or this will<br>\r\n`(26:16)` propagate as the probability<br>\r\n`(26:18)` that we end up at some state x at a time<br>\r\n`(26:22)` t<br>\r\n`(26:23)` if we start it add some x naught<br>\r\n`(26:27)` at a time t naught you know and we<br>\r\n`(26:30)` obtain this<br>\r\n`(26:31)` not by just requiring that this<br>\r\n`(26:33)` observable is a delta function<br>\r\n`(26:36)` where uh we say that the x the specific<br>\r\n`(26:39)` time<br>\r\n`(26:40)` t at a time t needs to be equal<br>\r\n`(26:43)` to the x that we give to the probability<br>\r\n`(26:46)` distribution here<br>\r\n`(26:50)` and then we plug that in and<br>\r\n`(26:53)` what we now need to say is that we only<br>\r\n`(26:56)` integrate<br>\r\n`(26:57)` over trajectories that actually started<br>\r\n`(27:00)` it's not an end<br>\r\n`(27:01)` and x at a given times now that's that's<br>\r\n`(27:04)` what we have to take to account for in<br>\r\n`(27:06)` the boundaries and the bounds of the<br>\r\n`(27:07)` integrals<br>\r\n`(27:08)` yeah and then we get this form here<br>\r\n`(27:13)` now that looks very similar and that's a<br>\r\n`(27:16)` different representation if you remember<br>\r\n`(27:18)` last time we had the<br>\r\n`(27:19)` koi maguro of uh chap and komogorov<br>\r\n`(27:21)` equation<br>\r\n`(27:22)` it was an equation for the same quantity<br>\r\n`(27:25)` and the idea was a little bit similar<br>\r\n`(27:27)` in this technical mcgovern<br>\r\n`(27:30)` equation we had the same spirit<br>\r\n`(27:33)` and we looked at different sums of<br>\r\n`(27:35)` different paths<br>\r\n`(27:37)` um a process could take to go from x<br>\r\n`(27:40)` naught to x<br>\r\n`(27:41)` and here we do the same thing in a more<br>\r\n`(27:43)` fancy way<br>\r\n`(27:49)` just to reflect on this a little bit<br>\r\n`(27:51)` more<br>\r\n`(27:52)` so what happened now so we started<br>\r\n`(27:55)` here with<br>\r\n`(27:59)` a longer equation we discretized it<br>\r\n`(28:03)` and if you remember uh quantum fields<br>\r\n`(28:06)` theory that's also the step that you do<br>\r\n`(28:08)` there<br>\r\n`(28:08)` you discretize time into small intervals<br>\r\n`(28:12)` as the first step if you derive<br>\r\n`(28:13)` a quantum fluid theory and then<br>\r\n`(28:17)` we wrote expectation values of some<br>\r\n`(28:19)` observables<br>\r\n`(28:20)` formally in a way that

field<br>\r\n`(28:42)` side tilde now that we still don't know<br>\r\n`(28:44)` what it is exactly about<br>\r\n`(28:46)` now we got that from the fourier<br>\r\n`(28:47)` transform of the delta

take these<br>\r\n`(31:46)` derivatives<br>\r\n`(31:48)` you know so we can therefore get the<br>\r\n`(31:52)` expectation values of combinations of<br>\r\n`(31:56)` the x<br>\r\n`(31:56)` and x tildes just by differentiating<br>\r\n`(31:59)` this<br>\r\n`(32:01)` generating functional with respect to<br>\r\n`(32:04)` these<br>\r\n`(32:05)` weird virtual fields<br>\r\n`(32:08)` yeah and when we've done that we have to<br>\r\n`(32:12)` remove these fields again so we have to<br>\r\n`(32:14)` set them back to zero<br>\r\n`(32:15)` now for example if you want to have the<br>\r\n`(32:17)` correlation the autocorrelation function<br>\r\n`(32:19)` so how much<br>\r\n`(32:21)` is the process at a time t correlated to<br>\r\n`(32:24)` the state at a time t<br>\r\n`(32:25)` prime yeah then we<br>\r\n`(32:28)` differentiate and we<br>\r\n`(32:32)` take the derivative first with respect<br>\r\n`(32:34)` to<br>\r\n`(32:35)` with respect to h at a certain time t<br>\r\n`(32:39)` yeah and then we get one of these axes<br>\r\n`(32:42)` here and then we take the derivative<br>\r\n`(32:44)` with uh to h at<br>\r\n`(32:48)` a time a different time t prime and then<br>\r\n`(32:50)` we get the field again<br>\r\n`(32:52)` at a different time here<br>\r\n`(32:55)` yeah and these are of course functional<br>\r\n`(32:57)` derivatives now that was<br>\r\n`(32:59)` uh functional calculus if you haven't<br>\r\n`(33:01)` done that<br>\r\n`(33:02)` it's uh for these what you what you do<br>\r\n`(33:04)` is you<br>\r\n`(33:05)` look at the change of a functional<br>\r\n`(33:08)` now for example this here is a<br>\r\n`(33:10)` functional<br>\r\n`(33:12)` we look at the change of a functional<br>\r\n`(33:15)` with respect to small<br>\r\n`(33:16)` changes of its argument also you have a<br>\r\n`(33:20)` look at<br>\r\n`(33:20)` perturbations in age and h tilde<br>\r\n`(33:24)` around some value yeah and then you<br>\r\n`(33:28)` see how your function changes that's<br>\r\n`(33:30)` called a functional derivative<br>\r\n`(33:32)` and if you do that you get very<br>\r\n`(33:34)` conveniently these pre-factors here<br>\r\n`(33:39)` right here in front of the action and if<br>\r\n`(33:42)` you look at<br>\r\n`(33:43)` the definition here this is just what<br>\r\n`(33:46)` gives us our observable<br>\r\n`(33:48)` as for example if our observable is x<br>\r\n`(33:52)` that we just take the derivative once<br>\r\n`(33:55)` we get an x here yeah<br>\r\n`(33:58)` and if we have the x here we have the<br>\r\n`(34:01)` first moment so the mean<br>\r\n`(34:03)` of x the average of x if we take the<br>\r\n`(34:06)` derivative twice<br>\r\n`(34:07)` at different times then we get a<br>\r\n`(34:09)` correlation here on the left-hand side<br>\r\n`(34:13)` so this is a very convenient tool and as<br>\r\n`(34:15)` i said<br>\r\n`(34:16)` if you want to have a correlation<br>\r\n`(34:18)` function for example we take the<br>\r\n`(34:19)` derivative<br>\r\n`(34:20)` twice and you must always remember to<br>\r\n`(34:23)` set<br>\r\n`(34:23)` these fields to zero again it's actually<br>\r\n`(34:26)` the same approach as you do in the<br>\r\n`(34:28)` quantity<br>\r\n`(34:29)` and classical field theory the<br>\r\n`(34:31)` equilibrium equilibrium field t<br>\r\n`(34:37)` okay so now what is this x<br>\r\n`(34:40)` of t that's just a remark so i'm

equations<br>\r\n`(34:58)` and you always get some kind of<br>\r\n`(35:01)` auxiliary<br>\r\n`(35:02)` field some some conjugate field that you<br>\r\n`(35:05)` have to pay for<br>\r\n`(35:07)` and uh this x tilde from here from here<br>\r\n`(35:10)` you can<br>\r\n`(35:12)` get an intuition about that i'm not<br>\r\n`(35:14)` super rigorous but you can get<br>\r\n`(35:16)` your intuition about this if you write<br>\r\n`(35:18)` down the master equation<br>\r\n`(35:20)` sorry the larger equation with respect<br>\r\n`(35:24)` and add some external source<br>\r\n`(35:27)` capital h of t<br>\r\n`(35:32)` you know and if you add this external<br>\r\n`(35:34)` force capital h<br>\r\n`(35:36)` of t now some temporally fluctuating<br>\r\n`(35:39)` force<br>\r\n`(35:40)` that doesn't

it to minikit<br>\r\n`(35:54)` then you see a formal analogy that if<br>\r\n`(35:57)` you<br>\r\n`(35:57)` that this you get a term that looks like<br>\r\n`(36:00)` h tilde<br>\r\n`(36:04)` if you define this to be minus i this<br>\r\n`(36:07)` external field<br>\r\n`(36:09)` yeah and now we can see what happens<br>\r\n`(36:14)` to x what is the effect of this external<br>\r\n`(36:17)` field<br>\r\n`(36:19)` h of t on x so there's a little bit in<br>\r\n`(36:22)` an<br>\r\n`(36:23)` analogy already here now so here on the<br>\r\n`(36:25)` left hand side it has something to do<br>\r\n`(36:27)` with this uh external field from the<br>\r\n`(36:31)` generating functional that couples to x<br>\r\n`(36:33)` tilde<br>\r\n`(36:34)` now let's see what this does to x to the<br>\r\n`(36:37)` actual stochastic process<br>\r\n`(36:39)` now to this end we calculate a response<br>\r\n`(36:43)` function<br>\r\n`(36:43)` and this response function is just the<br>\r\n`(36:47)` change<br>\r\n`(36:48)` in the average of f x with respect<br>\r\n`(36:52)` to changes in this external field<br>\r\n`(36:55)` that's called the response so how does<br>\r\n`(36:56)` the system respond<br>\r\n`(36:58)` to changes in this external field<br>\r\n`(37:01)` yeah and so as you remember the average<br>\r\n`(37:05)` here we just get by<br>\r\n`(37:08)` integrating uh by by taking this for<br>\r\n`(37:12)` this this generating functional<br>\r\n`(37:15)` and taking the derivative with respect<br>\r\n`(37:17)` to h<br>\r\n`(37:18)` once so that's the first moment<br>\r\n`(37:22)` and because of this equality here<br>\r\n`(37:27)` now we see that this year<br>\r\n`(37:30)` this response function is we also get<br>\r\n`(37:33)` that<br>\r\n`(37:33)` if we take the derivative with respect<br>\r\n`(37:36)` to h<br>\r\n`(37:37)` and then h tilde at a certain time<br>\r\n`(37:41)` t let me see let me just say<br>\r\n`(37:45)` here that's the tilde<br>\r\n`(37:51)` yeah and this here what this is<br>\r\n`(37:59)` as on the last slide is the correlation<br>\r\n`(38:02)` between<br>\r\n`(38:02)` x of t and x tilde of t<br>\r\n`(38:06)` now somehow the response of the system<br>\r\n`(38:10)` with respect to an external force<br>\r\n`(38:13)` or an infinitely miserable external<br>\r\n`(38:16)` force<br>\r\n`(38:17)` is given by how the x total<br>\r\n`(38:21)` couples to x<br>\r\n`(38:24)` so it describes the activity or is<br>\r\n`(38:27)` related<br>\r\n`(38:28)` to an infinitesimal response<br>\r\n`(38:32)` of x of the field x with respect<br>\r\n`(38:35)` to a small perturbation and that's why<br>\r\n`(38:39)` this field x tilde is also called the<br>\r\n`(38:41)` response field<br>\r\n`(38:44)` now there's just a little bit of<br>\r\n`(38:46)` intuition and very often this these<br>\r\n`(38:48)` conjugate variables somehow in some way<br>\r\n`(38:51)` encode the noise<br>\r\n`(38:56)` now i have an example uh let me just<br>\r\n`(38:59)` check the time whether we do it now or<br>\r\n`(39:01)` at the end of the lecture<br>\r\n`(39:05)` let's do it at the end

now i want to just give you a second<br>\r\n`(39:26)` remark<br>\r\n`(39:28)` so we are now in the framework of<br>\r\n`(39:29)` physicians<br>\r\n`(39:31)` and in field theory now if you remember<br>\r\n`(39:34)` we can have different formulations of<br>\r\n`(39:36)` field theories otherwise the lagrangian<br>\r\n`(39:39)` field theory and the hamiltonian field<br>\r\n`(39:42)` and we can translate these two into each<br>\r\n`(39:45)` other<br>\r\n`(39:45)` and we can do the same things here for<br>\r\n`(39:49)` the non-equilibrium for the stochastic<br>\r\n`(39:51)` process<br>\r\n`(39:53)` yeah and it's also just a remark no it's<br>\r\n`(39:56)` not<br>\r\n`(39:57)` so important for the rest of the lecture<br>\r\n`(40:00)` but you can formally define<br>\r\n`(40:03)` new variables q and<br>\r\n`(40:07)` p by these relations here<br>\r\n`(40:10)` and then this probability will take the<br>\r\n`(40:14)` form<br>\r\n`(40:14)` that i wrote down here now so this<br>\r\n`(40:18)` has formally the form of a hamiltonian<br>\r\n`(40:22)` action oh or having a hamiltonian theory<br>\r\n`(40:25)` so we have<br>\r\n`(40:26)` p times q dot minus<br>\r\n`(40:29)` some hamiltonian and this hamiltonian<br>\r\n`(40:32)` is given by this term here this looks a<br>\r\n`(40:35)` little bit like a kinetic energy so it's<br>\r\n`(40:38)` just<br>\r\n`(40:38)` just just saying that we can write by<br>\r\n`(40:41)` variable transformation we can write<br>\r\n`(40:42)` these<br>\r\n`(40:43)` field theories uh then quite analogously<br>\r\n`(40:47)` to feed theories that we already know<br>\r\n`(40:51)` and we can even go one step further<br>\r\n`(40:55)` now we can take this here and integrate<br>\r\n`(40:58)` out the piece<br>\r\n`(40:59)` now because it's just gradually<br>\r\n`(41:01)` quadratic in p<br>\r\n`(41:03)` so these are just essentially gaussian<br>\r\n`(41:05)` integrals that you can integrate over<br>\r\n`(41:06)` them<br>\r\n`(41:07)` and just to tell you the results that we<br>\r\n`(41:09)` then get<br>\r\n`(41:10)` a field theory that looks like a<br>\r\n`(41:13)` lagrangian field theory<br>\r\n`(41:16)` now we have a lagrangian that depends on<br>\r\n`(41:17)` q and the<br>\r\n`(41:19)` derivative of q with respect to time<br>\r\n`(41:22)` and if you then look at the analogy<br>\r\n`(41:26)` at this hammer at this land range here<br>\r\n`(41:28)` then<br>\r\n`(41:29)` this looks like it describes some kind<br>\r\n`(41:31)` of particle<br>\r\n`(41:32)` with that has some mass one over a uh<br>\r\n`(41:35)` that lays<br>\r\n`(41:36)` like in a potential that happens that's<br>\r\n`(41:38)` coupled to some<br>\r\n`(41:39)` q dot here and uh we have now here<br>\r\n`(41:43)` the quadratic potential of laughter now<br>\r\n`(41:46)` so now these analogies they're not very<br>\r\n`(41:48)` helpful yeah they don't tell you<br>\r\n`(41:49)` anything<br>\r\n`(41:50)` uh these hamiltonians that you get here<br>\r\n`(41:53)` uh<br>\r\n`(41:53)` they're not comparable to hamiltonians<br>\r\n`(41:55)` that you get important

what field theories are also<br>\r\n`(43:07)` good for<br>\r\n`(43:08)` are spatially extended systems<br>\r\n`(43:13)` now how do you write down a larger<br>\r\n`(43:16)` equation or a spatially extended system<br>\r\n`(43:19)` now it gets of course a little bit more<br>\r\n`(43:20)` complicated but there's actually a<br>\r\n`(43:22)` classification<br>\r\n`(43:23)` theme for a long general equation that<br>\r\n`(43:27)` describes systems<br>\r\n`(43:28)` that have spatial degrees of freedom<br>\r\n`(43:32)` and this classification scheme you can<br>\r\n`(43:34)` see on the slide<br>\r\n`(43:36)` and so we're looking here at some time<br>\r\n`(43:40)` evolution of some field phi<br>\r\n`(43:43)` at a position x at a time t<br>\r\n`(43:47)` and this time evolution is given by<br>\r\n`(43:49)` different components<br>\r\n`(43:51)` yeah that's r on the right hand sides on<br>\r\n`(43:54)` the very right we have the noise<br>\r\n`(43:56)` as always yeah and this noise<br>\r\n`(44:01)` now has the usual properties the average<br>\r\n`(44:04)` of the noise is zero<br>\r\n`(44:06)` and it also has correlations so how is<br>\r\n`(44:09)` a fluctuation a fluctuating force of<br>\r\n`(44:12)` that xi represents how is that<br>\r\n`(44:15)` correlated between different time points<br>\r\n`(44:18)` and how they correlated between<br>\r\n`(44:20)` different positions<br>\r\n`(44:21)` in space so while the assumption that<br>\r\n`(44:24)` different<br>\r\n`(44:25)` correlations that this noise is<br>\r\n`(44:28)` uncorrelated in time so that<br>\r\n`(44:30)` you don't have memory is something that<br>\r\n`(44:32)` is<br>\r\n`(44:33)` very reasonable and that we that we<br>\r\n`(44:35)` typically make<br>\r\n`(44:37)` it's not so clear that the noise is also<br>\r\n`(44:40)` independent at each position in space<br>\r\n`(44:44)` you know so generally there will be some<br>\r\n`(44:47)` some<br>\r\n`(44:48)` length you perturb the system and then<br>\r\n`(44:49)` you don't perturb a single atom<br>\r\n`(44:51)` yeah but you deter like a small region<br>\r\n`(44:54)` for example<br>\r\n`(44:55)` and then these fluctuating forces are<br>\r\n`(44:58)` correlated<br>\r\n`(45:00)` over small regions and these<br>\r\n`(45:02)` correlations in the spatial<br>\r\n`(45:06)` uh in these spatial systems and the<br>\r\n`(45:09)` fluctuating force that act on these<br>\r\n`(45:11)` systems<br>\r\n`(45:13)` are given by so-called spatial<br>\r\n`(45:15)` correlation<br>\r\n`(45:16)` now that just says how are these<br>\r\n`(45:19)` fluctuating forces<br>\r\n`(45:21)` how are they correlated between two<br>\r\n`(45:24)` given positions<br>\r\n`(45:25)` in space yeah and<br>\r\n`(45:28)` now we have the rest here<br>\r\n`(45:32)` the black parts here<br>\r\n`(45:35)` yeah it's just a fancy way of writing<br>\r\n`(45:38)` down<br>\r\n`(45:39)` the deterministic part of what's<br>\r\n`(45:42)` actually happening<br>\r\n`(45:44)` yeah and it's just a fancy way of<br>\r\n`(45:47)` writing down uh the actual<br>\r\n`(45:50)` uh for example chemical reactions<br>\r\n`(45:53)` that change the value of the field at a<br>\r\n`(45:56)` given position<br>\r\n`(45:58)` yeah and we can formally write down this<br>\r\n`(46:01)` uh this term by saying okay so we have<br>\r\n`(46:04)` some kind of potential<br>\r\n`(46:06)` and the dynamics will go so to some<br>\r\n`(46:09)` minimum<br>\r\n`(46:10)` of this potential not just some some<br>\r\n`(46:13)` equilibrium state<br>\r\n`(46:15)` yeah and then uh we can formally write<br>\r\n`(46:18)` this<br>\r\n`(46:18)` this way here that we have some<br>\r\n`(46:21)` functions and free energy functional<br>\r\n`(46:23)` f that depends on the fields and this is<br>\r\n`(46:26)` given by some input<br>\r\n`(46:28)` space integral uh where we have this<br>\r\n`(46:31)` term here that will flatten<br>\r\n`(46:33)` the field that something like can become<br>\r\n`(46:36)` a diffusion term<br>\r\n`(46:37)` and on the right hand side we have<br>\r\n`(46:40)` something<br>\r\n`(46:41)` that is a potential that describes<br>\r\n`(46:43)` what's actually which where we're going<br>\r\n`(46:44)` to with the field<br>\r\n`(46:46)` now if you have to have heard<br>\r\n`(46:48)` statistical physics<br>\r\n`(46:50)` yeah then uh these will look familiar to<br>\r\n`(46:53)` them<br>\r\n`(46:53)` to you like fight to the force theory<br>\r\n`(46:55)` ginsburg londo and so on<br>\r\n`(46:58)` now there's this red stuff here yeah and<br>\r\n`(47:01)` this red stuff is just a way<br>\r\n`(47:03)` of classifying different kinds of<br>\r\n`(47:06)` systems<br>\r\n`(47:07)` and people distinguish between system<br>\r\n`(47:10)` where the order parameter so our phi<br>\r\n`(47:13)` is not conserved for example in chemical<br>\r\n`(47:16)` systems where you can<br>\r\n`(47:17)` convert one chemical species to another<br>\r\n`(47:20)` chemical species<br>\r\n`(47:21)` yeah and then another chemical species<br>\r\n`(47:23)` and so on then the con<br>\r\n`(47:25)` concentration of one chemical species is<br>\r\n`(47:28)` not<br>\r\n`(47:28)` conserved in the entire system<br>\r\n`(47:32)` yeah and this is what you get if you set<br>\r\n`(47:34)` this exponent to zero<br>\r\n`(47:36)` that means you don't have this laplacian<br>\r\n`(47:38)` the second derivative here<br>\r\n`(47:42)` the other case is when you have<br>\r\n`(47:45)` set this to one here set this n to one<br>\r\n`(47:49)` then this will here be part of<br>\r\n`(47:52)` something like a diffusion term yeah<br>\r\n`(47:55)` this will go into a diffusion term<br>\r\n`(47:57)` and what you uh will then get is uh what<br>\r\n`(48:00)` is<br>\r\n`(48:00)` what what these kind of systems that<br>\r\n`(48:02)` describe are<br>\r\n`(48:04)` situations where the field supply is<br>\r\n`(48:06)` conserved<br>\r\n`(48:07)` now so you remove stuff at one point of<br>\r\n`(48:09)` the system if you remove stuff at one<br>\r\n`(48:11)` point of the system<br>\r\n`(48:12)` it has to pop up in another point<br>\r\n`(48:16)` an example is for example uh if you have<br>\r\n`(48:18)` something like hydrodynamics also where<br>\r\n`(48:20)` you just<br>\r\n`(48:20)` move mars around and uh but it doesn't<br>\r\n`(48:24)` really disappear<br>\r\n`(48:25)` and you just move things around but<br>\r\n`(48:27)` things don't disappear<br>\r\n`(48:28)` that's an example for these kind of<br>\r\n`(48:30)` model b<br>\r\n`(48:32)` systems yeah and<br>\r\n`(48:35)` uh so if you plug these things in so<br>\r\n`(48:37)` typical examples very famous example<br>\r\n`(48:39)` systems also called reaction diffusion<br>\r\n`(48:43)` systems<br>\r\n`(48:44)` now so and the typical reaction<br>\r\n`(48:45)` diffusion equation<br>\r\n`(48:47)` is seen here on the right hand side that<br>\r\n`(48:50)` describes a situation<br>\r\n`(48:52)` where uh the phi if you look here at the<br>\r\n`(48:55)` phi<br>\r\n`(48:56)` now then what happens what this term<br>\r\n`(48:59)` here does<br>\r\n`(49:00)` is a 5 is just a little bit larger than<br>\r\n`(49:03)` 0<br>\r\n`(49:04)` yeah then this term will be positive<br>\r\n`(49:07)` yeah and this this<br>\r\n`(49:10)` this will give to rise an increase in<br>\r\n`(49:12)` the field<br>\r\n`(49:14)` now this term is a diffusion term uh<br>\r\n`(49:17)` that just<br>\r\n`(49:17)` transports information to the set<br>\r\n`(49:19)` between different positions<br>\r\n`(49:21)` in the system and then we have our noise<br>\r\n`(49:24)` and this noise typically has<br>\r\n`(49:26)` prefactors it's multiplicative

so at the take home message for these<br>\r\n`(49:36)` spatial systems<br>\r\n`(49:38)` now we you can think about okay we just<br>\r\n`(49:40)` add an x variable well what i just said<br>\r\n`(49:42)` is just a complicated way of<br>\r\n`(49:44)` saying okay so we have some x variable<br>\r\n`(49:47)` and some diffusion yeah but everything<br>\r\n`(49:50)` else will look very similar as before<br>\r\n`(49:53)` now and indeed we can follow exactly the<br>\r\n`(49:56)` same steps now<br>\r\n`(49:57)` now we take the long-term equation<br>\r\n`(49:59)` general launch of my equation here<br>\r\n`(50:02)` you know which is this one i do exactly<br>\r\n`(50:05)` the same steps as before<br>\r\n`(50:07)` and now this here would be the first<br>\r\n`(50:10)` step<br>\r\n`(50:13)` now where we have this delta functions<br>\r\n`(50:16)` now now we don't only have a product<br>\r\n`(50:18)` over i<br>\r\n`(50:19)` that is already in the over time that is<br>\r\n`(50:21)` already in this delta function here<br>\r\n`(50:23)` but also over x yeah and then we just<br>\r\n`(50:26)` plug in this<br>\r\n`(50:27)` generalized launch of our equation and<br>\r\n`(50:29)` do the same step<br>\r\n`(50:31)` and then we get the field theory the<br>\r\n`(50:33)` martin citra rose functional<br>\r\n`(50:35)` for the spatially extended system so<br>\r\n`(50:38)` this looks pretty complicated<br>\r\n`(50:40)` but it is actually the same as before<br>\r\n`(50:43)` you know so we have we integrate again<br>\r\n`(50:46)` over the field fine and the response<br>\r\n`(50:50)` field<br>\r\n`(50:50)` file tilde and<br>\r\n`(50:54)` then we sum up different contributions<br>\r\n`(50:59)` to our variable to our observable like<br>\r\n`(51:02)` the second term<br>\r\n`(51:03)` and then as before we wait that<br>\r\n`(51:06)` with some exponential that essentially<br>\r\n`(51:10)` quantifies<br>\r\n`(51:10)` how far we are away from a realistic<br>\r\n`(51:14)` realization of the launching equation<br>\r\n`(51:17)` yeah and here we have<br>\r\n`(51:19)` exactly the same structure as before<br>\r\n`(51:22)` here you have the launch of the equation<br>\r\n`(51:25)` now you see you say that you need to<br>\r\n`(51:27)` solve the deterministic part of the<br>\r\n`(51:29)` moisture equation<br>\r\n`(51:31)` and this was previously just<br>\r\n`(51:34)` x tilde squared i said previously<br>\r\n`(51:40)` this was this term here<br>\r\n`(51:43)` was something like a<br>\r\n`(51:46)` over 2 x to the squared<br>\r\n`(51:50)` well now that looks more complicated<br>\r\n`(51:52)` yeah but it has the same form as if you<br>\r\n`(51:54)` look at this<br>\r\n`(51:56)` you have here your x tilde or phi tilde<br>\r\n`(52:00)` here you have another one that just<br>\r\n`(52:03)` coupled by the correlations in the noise<br>\r\n`(52:07)` uh that is described by this voice<br>\r\n`(52:10)` kernel<br>\r\n`(52:11)` now but the

the<br>\r\n`(52:22)` spatially extended system<br>\r\n`(52:25)` yeah and with this uh i'm done with the<br>\r\n`(52:29)` definitions<br>\r\n`(52:29)` and with the actual<br>\r\n`(52:33)` derivation of

an<br>\r\n`(52:49)` hour<br>\r\n`(52:50)` so if you don't already know all of this<br>\r\n`(52:52)` maybe from last year's lecture<br>\r\n`(52:53)` then uh feel free to feel free for her<br>\r\n`(52:56)` to drop out<br>\r\n`(52:56)` and for the rest i'll go through one<br>\r\n`(52:58)` example<br>\r\n`(53:00)` and i'll double check so if i upload<br>\r\n`(53:02)` when i upload the uh<br>\r\n`(53:04)` the lecture notes i'll try to make sure<br>\r\n`(53:06)` that actually these minus signs<br>\r\n`(53:09)` are correct yeah so so if there was a<br>\r\n`(53:11)` mistake i'll correct it<br>\r\n`(53:12)` in the uploaded version that you find on<br>\r\n`(53:15)` the website<br>\r\n`(53:17)` excuse me yes so<br>\r\n`(53:20)` when you wrote the response function<br>\r\n`(53:23)` there was this i guess heavyside<br>\r\n`(53:28)` function multiplied with<br>\r\n`(53:29)` your autocorrelation so<br>\r\n`(53:33)` does that come up because uh you have<br>\r\n`(53:36)` a kind of the etho formalism<br>\r\n`(53:39)` into your system the point<br>\r\n`(53:44)` the response function if you have a<br>\r\n`(53:46)` perturbation here<br>\r\n`(53:48)` if you perturb at t prime and you look<br>\r\n`(53:50)` at the response at t<br>\r\n`(53:52)` now that's how this response function is<br>\r\n`(53:55)` defined<br>\r\n`(53:56)` answer you should have here that's a d<br>\r\n`(53:58)` prime<br>\r\n`(53:59)` here as you perturb at t prime and you<br>\r\n`(54:02)` look<br>\r\n`(54:03)` at the time t yeah then<br>\r\n`(54:06)` oh the other way around actually the<br>\r\n`(54:08)` answer so then then this<br>\r\n`(54:12)` herbicide function just ensures<br>\r\n`(54:15)` causality<br>\r\n`(54:16)` that you cannot observe the response<br>\r\n`(54:19)` that hap that happens before you could<br>\r\n`(54:20)` do the perturbation before you apply the<br>\r\n`(54:22)` force<br>\r\n`(54:25)` now so that's that's that's the reason<br>\r\n`(54:27)` why you get these tata functions<br>\r\n`(54:30)` okay okay thanks for the question<br>\r\n`(54:35)` let's go then to the<br>\r\n`(54:42)` first example<br>\r\n`(54:46)` here we go yeah and<br>\r\n`(54:49)` uh so let's let's have a look at the<br>\r\n`(54:52)` fields here for a very<br>\r\n`(54:54)` simple example and all like in the<br>\r\n`(54:56)` stochastic processes<br>\r\n`(54:58)` also simple examples quickly become<br>\r\n`(55:04)` complicated<br>\r\n`(55:06)` so let me find the notes<br>\r\n`(55:11)` here we go<br>\r\n`(55:18)` okay we start with a simple<br>\r\n`(55:22)` with probably one of the simplest larger<br>\r\n`(55:24)` way equation uh you can<br>\r\n`(55:26)` imagine and uh because it's so simple<br>\r\n`(55:29)` uh it has a name because it has been<br>\r\n`(55:32)` extensively<br>\r\n`(55:33)` studied and it's called the einstein<br>\r\n`(55:35)` ruling<br>\r\n`(55:36)` process and this process is just given<br>\r\n`(55:40)` by the time<br>\r\n`(55:41)` by the time derivative of x<br>\r\n`(55:45)` dot and this is equal to<br>\r\n`(55:48)` some restoring force all right so plus<br>\r\n`(55:51)` sometimes<br>\r\n`(55:52)` uh some external fluctuating force<br>\r\n`(55:56)` side and as always we have the usual<br>\r\n`(55:59)` conditions that are outside<br>\r\n`(56:00)` very nicely behaved doesn't have a mean<br>\r\n`(56:04)` and it's uncorrelated in time<br>\r\n`(56:08)` so now writing down the margin citra<br>\r\n`(56:12)` rose<br>\r\n`(56:13)` function integral easy because we just<br>\r\n`(56:16)` have to plug in this laundromate<br>\r\n`(56:18)` equation<br>\r\n`(56:19)` so martin<br>\r\n`(56:23)` martin cedar rose johnson the dominicus<br>\r\n`(56:28)` some people say martin said rose i did<br>\r\n`(56:30)` that once and i happened to be in munich<br>\r\n`(56:32)` and then i they were very angry that i<br>\r\n`(56:34)` forgot johnson<br>\r\n`(56:36)` my parents apparently had some<br>\r\n`(56:37)` connections to munich<br>\r\n`(56:40)` and uh now so that's the full<br>\r\n`(56:43)` that that that contains i think<br>\r\n`(56:45)` everybody who contributed<br>\r\n`(56:47)` uh<br>\r\n`(56:52)` reads now so what is the action now just<br>\r\n`(56:56)` i don't write the full integral just<br>\r\n`(56:57)` write the action<br>\r\n`(56:59)` so the action is<br>\r\n`(57:03)` dt i x tilde<br>\r\n`(57:12)` del t x plus alpha x<br>\r\n`(57:19)` now let's make sure that we fulfill the<br>\r\n`(57:21)` login equation<br>\r\n`(57:23)` plus a over 2<br>\r\n`(57:27)` dt<br>\r\n`(57:31)` x tilde now that would be squared<br>\r\n`(57:37)` now we can write down the generating<br>\r\n`(57:39)` function<br>\r\n`(57:41)` generating<br>\r\n`(57:47)` functional yeah and this is just as<br>\r\n`(57:50)` before<br>\r\n`(57:52)` that of h is tilde<br>\r\n`(57:57)` is equal to the integral<br>\r\n`(58:00)` over our two fields function interval of<br>\r\n`(58:02)` the word two fields<br>\r\n`(58:04)` field response field uh<br>\r\n`(58:07)` e to the minus s<br>\r\n`(58:11)` plus dt<br>\r\n`(58:15)` h x so that the external auxiliary field<br>\r\n`(58:19)` that comes to x<br>\r\n`(58:21)` plus an external field that couples<br>\r\n`(58:24)` to x tilde<br>\r\n`(58:28)` yeah and uh just<br>\r\n`(58:31)` just to make sure everybody understands<br>\r\n`(58:33)` now so why do i say that this field<br>\r\n`(58:35)` couples to x<br>\r\n`(58:36)` and x tilde here so these and why are<br>\r\n`(58:38)` these external fields<br>\r\n`(58:40)` provided like this this just follows if<br>\r\n`(58:42)` you write down<br>\r\n`(58:43)` um something like for example the<br>\r\n`(58:45)` ginsburg landlord theory also<br>\r\n`(58:48)` or you look at the icing model now then<br>\r\n`(58:50)` terms like this here<br>\r\n`(58:55)` will tilt the potential in one direction<br>\r\n`(58:59)` yeah and here this tilts the potential<br>\r\n`(59:04)` in the x-direction and this tills the<br>\r\n`(59:06)` potential in the axillary<br>\r\n`(59:07)` direction this tilts it in the x<br>\r\n`(59:10)` direction<br>\r\n`(59:12)` and this tilts it in the x tilde<br>\r\n`(59:14)` direction<br>\r\n`(59:16)` now so this is why we call these<br>\r\n`(59:17)` external fields<br>\r\n`(59:19)` and that they couple to uh<br>\r\n`(59:22)` these fields x and x that's the analogy<br>\r\n`(59:26)` to uh the ginsberg london theory and<br>\r\n`(59:29)` other fields<br>\r\n`(59:32)` okay so let's go this is the<br>\r\n`(59:35)` um functional generating functional<br>\r\n`(59:40)` and now we use that<br>\r\n`(59:44)` integral over dx e to the iq x<br>\r\n`(59:48)` is just delta of q so we use the<br>\r\n`(59:52)` definition of the fourier transform of<br>\r\n`(59:54)` the delta function<br>\r\n`(59:56)` and by doing that we get that<br>\r\n`(60:00)` this functional generative function<br>\r\n`(60:04)` is equal to d of<br>\r\n`(60:07)` x to the e<br>\r\n`(60:11)` to the a over two<br>\r\n`(60:16)` integral dt x to the squared<br>\r\n`(60:22)` plus dt<br>\r\n`(60:26)` our two fields h x<br>\r\n`(60:29)` plus h tilde x<br>\r\n`(60:33)` yeah and now we've got our delta<br>\r\n`(60:37)` function<br>\r\n`(60:39)` i del t minus alpha<br>\r\n`(60:44)` x to the plus h<br>\r\n`(60:53)` now when is this delta function here the<br>\r\n`(60:56)` delta function<br>\r\n`(60:58)` actually non-zero now so the delta<br>\r\n`(61:02)` delta functional<br>\r\n`(61:08)` is non zero<br>\r\n`(61:11)` if our x tilde<br>\r\n`(61:15)` solves this ordinary differential<br>\r\n`(61:18)` equation<br>\r\n`(61:20)` you know that we have here in the delta<br>\r\n`(61:22)` function now we can just write it down<br>\r\n`(61:26)` i times t to infinity<br>\r\n`(61:30)` dt prime e to the minus<br>\r\n`(61:35)` alpha t minus p prime<br>\r\n`(61:39)` h of t prime yeah<br>\r\n`(61:45)` now we substitute that so we saw that we<br>\r\n`(61:48)` already got rid of<br>\r\n`(61:49)` one field here by doing this reverse<br>\r\n`(61:53)` fury transform now we substitute that we<br>\r\n`(61:56)` get<br>\r\n`(61:57)` rid of our second field now we<br>\r\n`(61:59)` substitute<br>\r\n`(62:05)` into that<br>\r\n`(62:11)` and what we get<br>\r\n`(62:14)` is age h tilde<br>\r\n`(62:17)` is equal to and now comes a large<br>\r\n`(62:20)` exponential<br>\r\n`(62:21)` to see how to write that on the screen<br>\r\n`(62:26)` minus integral dt<br>\r\n`(62:30)` integral dt prime the second it comes<br>\r\n`(62:34)` from this x tilde<br>\r\n`(62:35)` and then we have<br>\r\n`(62:39)` a over 2 e to the minus<br>\r\n`(62:42)` alpha t minus t prime<br>\r\n`(62:48)` times h of t<br>\r\n`(62:53)` h of t prime plus<br>\r\n`(62:57)` i theta<br>\r\n`(63:00)` t minus t prime<br>\r\n`(63:03)` e to the minus alpha t<br>\r\n`(63:07)` minus t prime<br>\r\n`(63:10)` times i'm sorry i said it like<br>\r\n`(63:14)` even for the simplest process it gets<br>\r\n`(63:16)` lengthy<br>\r\n`(63:17)` h of t h of t prime<br>\r\n`(63:21)` yeah but what's happening here is<br>\r\n`(63:24)` nothing magical it's just a calculation<br>\r\n`(63:26)` such<br>\r\n`(63:26)` integrals well we substituted that x<br>\r\n`(63:29)` total<br>\r\n`(63:31)` into our generating functional and then<br>\r\n`(63:34)` we collected the terms<br>\r\n`(63:35)` and made sure<br>\r\n`(63:40)` that the right time order<br>\r\n`(63:43)` is given and now we have this generating<br>\r\n`(63:46)` function it looks a little bit<br>\r\n`(63:47)` complicated<br>\r\n`(63:48)` but we can deal with that now so we can<br>\r\n`(63:51)` take<br>\r\n`(63:52)` functional derivatives with this now for<br>\r\n`(63:54)` example to get a correlation function<br>\r\n`(64:02)` and so we have x<br>\r\n`(64:06)` of the x of t prime<br>\r\n`(64:10)` now we take the second<br>\r\n`(64:14)` derivative<br>\r\n`(64:19)` once at time t<br>\r\n`(64:24)` and once at time t prime<br>\r\n`(64:30)` and then we must not forget<br>\r\n`(64:33)` to set the fields equal to zero again<br>\r\n`(64:40)` now and if you look at this equation if<br>\r\n`(64:43)` we do that<br>\r\n`(64:44)` then and do a little bit of calculations<br>\r\n`(64:48)` don't<br>\r\n`(64:48)` get that actually this correlation<br>\r\n`(64:50)` function is<br>\r\n`(64:51)` a over alpha e to the minus alpha<br>\r\n`(64:56)` t minus t prime<br>\r\n`(65:02)` so that's just uh an example yeah so<br>\r\n`(65:05)` these actual calculations<br>\r\n`(65:06)` are a little bit messy but that's not<br>\r\n`(65:09)` just how you use these field theories<br>\r\n`(65:12)` that you have the field theory you write<br>\r\n`(65:14)` down the general functional<br>\r\n`(65:16)` yeah and then you look that you are able<br>\r\n`(65:19)` to<br>\r\n`(65:19)` take these functional derivatives with<br>\r\n`(65:22)` respect to these external fields<br>\r\n`(65:24)` and the rest is then say<br>\r\n`(65:28)` mathematics yeah<br>\r\n`(65:32)` okay great so this was an example and<br>\r\n`(65:35)` from next week<br>\r\n`(65:35)` we'll be a little bit more intuitive<br>\r\n`(65:37)` again now we've covered the technical<br>\r\n`(65:39)` stuff<br>\r\n`(65:40)` uh and we can look into some real uh<br>\r\n`(65:43)` physics<br>\r\n`(65:44)` and physics problems okay see you all<br>\r\n`(65:47)` next week<br>\r\n`(65:48)` bye
