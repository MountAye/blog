However, the corresponding Chinese Wikipedia entry doesn’t cover as much content as the English version, so it’s not entirely a waste of effort.\n\n## Information and Probability\n\nInformation is expressed through a proposition, which can represent multiple propositions through logical operations. This proposition answers a specific question. Before receiving definite information, many other propositions could potentially be answers to this question, making probability theory applicable. Together, all possible propositions form a random variable space.\n\nFor example, in a multiple-choice question with four options, A, B, C, and D:\n- If it’s a single-choice question, the random variable space for the answer is $${A,B,C,D}$$.\n- If it’s multiple-choice, it’s $${A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD}$$, and so on.\n\n## Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\n\n### Self-Information\n\nSelf-information is a property of a random event or a specific possible value of a random variable. It is expressed as:\n\n$$ I(m) = -\\log_n\\left(p(M=m)\\right) $$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, but the logarithm base can vary:\n\n- When $$n=2$$, the unit is called a bit or shannon. A shannon represents the **maximum information** a binary digit can convey.\n- When $$n=e$$, the unit is nat, with loge or $$ln=\\log_e$$ being the natural logarithm.    \n- When $$n=10$$, the unit is hartley.\n\nThe formula is significant in information theory as it represents the minimum number of single-choice questions with nnn options required to find the answer.\n\n### Entropy\n\nEntropy is the overall property of a random variable’s probability distribution. The formula is straightforward, as it’s the expected value of self-information:\n\n$$S(p(M))=\\mathbb{E}_p[-\\log_n p(M)]=-\\sum_{m\\in M}p(m)\\log_n p(m)$$\n\nFor example, binary entropy for a specific random event would be:\n\n$$ S_{binary} = -(1-p)\\log(1-p)-p\\log p $$\n\nEntropy in information theory signifies the minimum number of questions required to equate to the information contained in multiple propositions.\n\n## Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\n\n### Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\n\nAlso known as relative entropy or I-divergence, K-L divergence is defined for two probability distributions of the same random variable space:\n\n$$ D_{KL}(p(X)|q(X))=\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\n\nThis measures the **extra** number of single-choice questions required when using the optimal questions for $$q(X)$$ instead of $$p(X)$$.\n\n### Cross Entropy\n\nCross entropy describes the total number of single-choice questions needed when using the questions optimal for $$q(X)$$ with respect to $$p(X)$$:\n\n$$ CE(p(X),q(X))=-\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log q(x) $$\n\nBinary cross entropy between ppp and qqq can be expressed as:\n\n$$ BCE(p,q)=-p\\log q-(1-p)\\log(1-q) $$\n\n\n### Mutual Information\n\nMutual information, defined for two different random variable spaces, XXX and YYY, is:\n\n$$ MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} $$\n\nThis measures the difference between the joint distribution of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and the assumption that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, with $$MI=0$$ if they are independent.\n\n## Sidebar Discussion\n\n### Loss Functions in PyTorch\n\nSome relevant loss functions in PyTorch are:\n\n- `torch.nn.KLDivLoss`\n- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCELoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`\n\n### Boltzmann’s Epitaph\n\n$$ S=k\\log W $$\n\nHere, $$S$$ is the thermodynamic entropy, $$k$$ is Boltzmann’s constant $$k_B$$, and $$W$$ is the number of microstates. In statistical mechanics, when all states are equally probable, information entropy and thermodynamic entropy differ only by $$k_B$$.\n\n### Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\n\nIn 451 AD, Attila invaded Roman territory and battled a coalition led by Aetius, including Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. Before the battle, Attila consulted a fortune teller who predicted the death of a king and the collapse of a state. Attila assumed Theodoric would fall, but it turned out that while Theodoric did die, the coalition defeated the Huns, and Attila’s ambitions were thwarted.\n\nThis story illustrates how fortune tellers employ low-information predictions that lead people to infer higher-information outcomes, playing on the difference in entropy between statements.\n"},"tocStr":"{\"index\":null,\"endIndex\":null,\"map\":{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#information-and-probability\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Information and Probability\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#quantifying-information-in-a-probability-distribution\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\"}]}]},{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#self-information\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Self-Information\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#entropy\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Entropy\"}]}]}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#comparing-information-content-in-two-probability-distributions\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\"}]}]},{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#kullbackleibler-k-l-divergence\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#cross-entropy\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Cross Entropy\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#mutual-information\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Mutual Information\"}]}]}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#sidebar-discussion\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Sidebar Discussion\"}]}]},{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#loss-functions-in-pytorch\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Loss Functions in PyTorch\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#boltzmanns-epitaph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Boltzmann’s Epitaph\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#fortune-telling-and-low-information-content\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After feeling self-satisfied for a while, I realized that this article is basically a translation of the English Wikipedia entry Quantities of Information.

However, the corresponding Chinese Wikipedia entry doesn’t cover as much content as the English version, so it’s not entirely a waste of effort.\n\n## Information and Probability\n\nInformation is expressed through a proposition, which can represent multiple propositions through logical operations. This proposition answers a specific question. Before receiving definite information, many other propositions could potentially be answers to this question, making probability theory applicable. Together, all possible propositions form a random variable space.\n\nFor example, in a multiple-choice question with four options, A, B, C, and D:\n- If it’s a single-choice question, the random variable space for the answer is $${A,B,C,D}$$.\n- If it’s multiple-choice, it’s $${A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD}$$, and so on.\n\n## Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\n\n### Self-Information\n\nSelf-information is a property of a random event or a specific possible value of a random variable. It is expressed as:\n\n$$ I(m) = -\\log_n\\left(p(M=m)\\right) $$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, but the logarithm base can vary:\n\n- When $$n=2$$, the unit is called a bit or shannon. A shannon represents the **maximum information** a binary digit can convey.\n- When $$n=e$$, the unit is nat, with loge or $$ln=\\log_e$$ being the natural logarithm.    \n- When $$n=10$$, the unit is hartley.\n\nThe formula is significant in information theory as it represents the minimum number of single-choice questions with nnn options required to find the answer.\n\n### Entropy\n\nEntropy is the overall property of a random variable’s probability distribution. The formula is straightforward, as it’s the expected value of self-information:\n\n$$S(p(M))=\\mathbb{E}_p[-\\log_n p(M)]=-\\sum_{m\\in M}p(m)\\log_n p(m)$$\n\nFor example, binary entropy for a specific random event would be:\n\n$$ S_{binary} = -(1-p)\\log(1-p)-p\\log p $$\n\nEntropy in information theory signifies the minimum number of questions required to equate to the information contained in multiple propositions.\n\n## Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\n\n### Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\n\nAlso known as relative entropy or I-divergence, K-L divergence is defined for two probability distributions of the same random variable space:\n\n$$ D_{KL}(p(X)|q(X))=\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\n\nThis measures the **extra** number of single-choice questions required when using the optimal questions for $$q(X)$$ instead of $$p(X)$$.\n\n### Cross Entropy\n\nCross entropy describes the total number of single-choice questions needed when using the questions optimal for $$q(X)$$ with respect to $$p(X)$$:\n\n$$ CE(p(X),q(X))=-\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log q(x) $$\n\nBinary cross entropy between ppp and qqq can be expressed as:\n\n$$ BCE(p,q)=-p\\log q-(1-p)\\log(1-q) $$\n\n\n### Mutual Information\n\nMutual information, defined for two different random variable spaces, XXX and YYY, is:\n\n$$ MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} $$\n\nThis measures the difference between the joint distribution of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and the assumption that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, with $$MI=0$$ if they are independent.\n\n## Sidebar Discussion\n\n### Loss Functions in PyTorch\n\nSome relevant loss functions in PyTorch are:\n\n- `torch.nn.KLDivLoss`\n- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCELoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`\n\n### Boltzmann’s Epitaph\n\n$$ S=k\\log W $$\n\nHere, $$S$$ is the thermodynamic entropy, $$k$$ is Boltzmann’s constant $$k_B$$, and $$W$$ is the number of microstates. In statistical mechanics, when all states are equally probable, information entropy and thermodynamic entropy differ only by $$k_B$$.\n\n### Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\n\nIn 451 AD, Attila invaded Roman territory and battled a coalition led by Aetius, including Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. Before the battle, Attila consulted a fortune teller who predicted the death of a king and the collapse of a state. Attila assumed Theodoric would fall, but it turned out that while Theodoric did die, the coalition defeated the Huns, and Attila’s ambitions were thwarted.\n\nThis story illustrates how fortune tellers employ low-information predictions that lead people to infer higher-information outcomes, playing on the difference in entropy between statements.\n"},{"slug":"notes-during-APS-march-meeting-2022-Chicago","filename":"2023-03-12-notes-during-APS-march-meeting-2022-Chicago.md","date":"2023-03-12","title":".tex | Notes during APS March Meeting 2022 in Chicago","layout":"post","keywords":["tex","phy"],"excerpt":"Notes during the March Meeting in 2022 Chicago","content":"\n## Physical of Artificial System\n\nsome physical learning that does not have to be in equilibrium\n\n## Cell fate\n\n### Xinhua Xing’s talk\n\nintro to differential geometry: Kamien, Rev Mod Phys 74:953 (2002)\n\nWeiKang Wang, in silico vector field analysis\n\nWaddington landscape 1957\n\nJoanathan Weissman Lab (WI, MIT) \n\n### Maria’s Talk\n\nBoston U, Pankaj Mahta Group.\n\nextension  of work from Lang et al PLoS comput bio (2014)\n\nfound an order parameter, better than UMAP \n\n### Shubham Tripathi’s talk\n\nmiimally frustrated topology\n\n### Glassy fluctuation ...\n\nproten and mRNA noise levels are Boltzmann distributed.\n\nspin glass: frustration\n\nfree energy \n\ngene expression noise can store information\n\n### Kraemer\n\ncell types in multicellular organisms\n\nmaster regulator as order parameter\n\n**Hopfield model**\n\nforward and backward conditional probabilities\n\n### Logan Carpenter\n\ntissue homeostasis: birth and death\n\ncellular Potts model\n\nthere is Hamiltonian!\n\nCompuCell3D software\n\ncell size distribution plot is very good\n\n### Lo’s talk\n\nUWashington\n\ncollision during cell cycle, replication and transcription\n\nF-mean\n\n### Lambert.io\n\nbacterial persistence\n\nCRISPER-dCas12a interference\n\nmassive parallel assay\n\n\n### Arkansas U talk\n\nReversibiliy and cell division dynamics of elongated Escherichia coli cells obtained at high pressure\n\na new cell division model\n\nGCDM\n\ncontinuous time Markov chain model?\n\n### Vivek\n\nmicrobial colonizing and phenotypes\n\nDanio rerio\n\nvirio Z20\n\n### Louis Cortes\n\nIPTG indeces lac operon\n\n$f(t)=1-e^{-\\frac{ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}(t-t_0)}$\n\n### Jintao Li\n\ncell competition\n\nhomeostasis pressure\n\n## Author & Reference Session\n\n### criteria\n\n- significantly advance physics\n- scientifically\n- letter\n    - advance in field\n    - open a new\n    - solve a problem\n    - be of great interest\n\n### for authors\n\n- identify audience\n- take-home message\n- adequate literature\n- authorship & acknowledgment\n- additional info\n    - suggested reviewer\n    - conflicts of interest\n    - related paper\n    - PRL/X: justification for suitability exclusively to\n\n## referee\n\n- novel, interesting, original\n- valid and reproducible\n- well presented\n- report\n    - summary\n    - technical details\n    - decision explained\n- report requirements\n    - substantiated\n    - a reasonable level of details\n    - no personal/self-serving remarks\n    - timeliness\n\n### joint submissions\n\n### updated PhySH\n\n## K42: Network Theory and Applications to Complex Systems\n\n### Complex Contagion: Unfolding and Control\n\nAdilson E.

The matrix can be made up of various components such as proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals, and it can be found in different biological contexts, such as bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix surrounding cells.\n> \n> For example, in bone tissue, the extracellular matrix provides support and rigidity to the bone and is primarily composed of collagen fibers and mineralized calcium phosphate. In cartilage, the matrix is composed of collagen and proteoglycans and serves as a cushion between bones in joints. In connective tissue, the matrix provides support and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between cells.\n> \n> In summary, the matrix is an essential component of many biological tissues and provides structural support and a medium for cellular interactions.\n> \n\n### epithelia tissues as hexnematic liquid cystals, and instabilities\n\nHeager et al,  J.

The study uses an active **vertex model** to demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for distinct rotational dynamics. The study also investigates the emergence of chiral symmetry breaking in multicellular systems using experiments and simulations of rotating pancreas spheres. The authors propose that topological defects in the polarity field underlie the symmetry breaking.

However, the corresponding Chinese Wikipedia entry doesn’t cover as much content as the English version, so it’s not entirely a waste of effort.\n\n## Information and Probability\n\nInformation is expressed through a proposition, which can represent multiple propositions through logical operations. This proposition answers a specific question. Before receiving definite information, many other propositions could potentially be answers to this question, making probability theory applicable. Together, all possible propositions form a random variable space.\n\nFor example, in a multiple-choice question with four options, A, B, C, and D:\n- If it’s a single-choice question, the random variable space for the answer is $${A,B,C,D}$$.\n- If it’s multiple-choice, it’s $${A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD}$$, and so on.\n\n## Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\n\n### Self-Information\n\nSelf-information is a property of a random event or a specific possible value of a random variable. It is expressed as:\n\n$$ I(m) = -\\log_n\\left(p(M=m)\\right) $$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, but the logarithm base can vary:\n\n- When $$n=2$$, the unit is called a bit or shannon. A shannon represents the **maximum information** a binary digit can convey.\n- When $$n=e$$, the unit is nat, with loge or $$ln=\\log_e$$ being the natural logarithm.    \n- When $$n=10$$, the unit is hartley.\n\nThe formula is significant in information theory as it represents the minimum number of single-choice questions with nnn options required to find the answer.\n\n### Entropy\n\nEntropy is the overall property of a random variable’s probability distribution. The formula is straightforward, as it’s the expected value of self-information:\n\n$$S(p(M))=\\mathbb{E}_p[-\\log_n p(M)]=-\\sum_{m\\in M}p(m)\\log_n p(m)$$\n\nFor example, binary entropy for a specific random event would be:\n\n$$ S_{binary} = -(1-p)\\log(1-p)-p\\log p $$\n\nEntropy in information theory signifies the minimum number of questions required to equate to the information contained in multiple propositions.\n\n## Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\n\n### Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\n\nAlso known as relative entropy or I-divergence, K-L divergence is defined for two probability distributions of the same random variable space:\n\n$$ D_{KL}(p(X)|q(X))=\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\n\nThis measures the **extra** number of single-choice questions required when using the optimal questions for $$q(X)$$ instead of $$p(X)$$.\n\n### Cross Entropy\n\nCross entropy describes the total number of single-choice questions needed when using the questions optimal for $$q(X)$$ with respect to $$p(X)$$:\n\n$$ CE(p(X),q(X))=-\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log q(x) $$\n\nBinary cross entropy between ppp and qqq can be expressed as:\n\n$$ BCE(p,q)=-p\\log q-(1-p)\\log(1-q) $$\n\n\n### Mutual Information\n\nMutual information, defined for two different random variable spaces, XXX and YYY, is:\n\n$$ MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} $$\n\nThis measures the difference between the joint distribution of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and the assumption that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, with $$MI=0$$ if they are independent.\n\n## Sidebar Discussion\n\n### Loss Functions in PyTorch\n\nSome relevant loss functions in PyTorch are:\n\n- `torch.nn.KLDivLoss`\n- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCELoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`\n\n### Boltzmann’s Epitaph\n\n$$ S=k\\log W $$\n\nHere, $$S$$ is the thermodynamic entropy, $$k$$ is Boltzmann’s constant $$k_B$$, and $$W$$ is the number of microstates. In statistical mechanics, when all states are equally probable, information entropy and thermodynamic entropy differ only by $$k_B$$.\n\n### Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\n\nIn 451 AD, Attila invaded Roman territory and battled a coalition led by Aetius, including Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. Before the battle, Attila consulted a fortune teller who predicted the death of a king and the collapse of a state. Attila assumed Theodoric would fall, but it turned out that while Theodoric did die, the coalition defeated the Huns, and Attila’s ambitions were thwarted.\n\nThis story illustrates how fortune tellers employ low-information predictions that lead people to infer higher-information outcomes, playing on the difference in entropy between statements.\n"},{"slug":"notes-during-APS-march-meeting-2022-Chicago","filename":"2023-03-12-notes-during-APS-march-meeting-2022-Chicago.md","date":"2023-03-12","title":".tex | Notes during APS March Meeting 2022 in Chicago","layout":"post","keywords":["tex","phy"],"excerpt":"Notes during the March Meeting in 2022 Chicago","content":"\n## Physical of Artificial System\n\nsome physical learning that does not have to be in equilibrium\n\n## Cell fate\n\n### Xinhua Xing’s talk\n\nintro to differential geometry: Kamien, Rev Mod Phys 74:953 (2002)\n\nWeiKang Wang, in silico vector field analysis\n\nWaddington landscape 1957\n\nJoanathan Weissman Lab (WI, MIT) \n\n### Maria’s Talk\n\nBoston U, Pankaj Mahta Group.\n\nextension  of work from Lang et al PLoS comput bio (2014)\n\nfound an order parameter, better than UMAP \n\n### Shubham Tripathi’s talk\n\nmiimally frustrated topology\n\n### Glassy fluctuation ...\n\nproten and mRNA noise levels are Boltzmann distributed.\n\nspin glass: frustration\n\nfree energy \n\ngene expression noise can store information\n\n### Kraemer\n\ncell types in multicellular organisms\n\nmaster regulator as order parameter\n\n**Hopfield model**\n\nforward and backward conditional probabilities\n\n### Logan Carpenter\n\ntissue homeostasis: birth and death\n\ncellular Potts model\n\nthere is Hamiltonian!\n\nCompuCell3D software\n\ncell size distribution plot is very good\n\n### Lo’s talk\n\nUWashington\n\ncollision during cell cycle, replication and transcription\n\nF-mean\n\n### Lambert.io\n\nbacterial persistence\n\nCRISPER-dCas12a interference\n\nmassive parallel assay\n\n\n### Arkansas U talk\n\nReversibiliy and cell division dynamics of elongated Escherichia coli cells obtained at high pressure\n\na new cell division model\n\nGCDM\n\ncontinuous time Markov chain model?\n\n### Vivek\n\nmicrobial colonizing and phenotypes\n\nDanio rerio\n\nvirio Z20\n\n### Louis Cortes\n\nIPTG indeces lac operon\n\n$f(t)=1-e^{-\\frac{ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}(t-t_0)}$\n\n### Jintao Li\n\ncell competition\n\nhomeostasis pressure\n\n## Author & Reference Session\n\n### criteria\n\n- significantly advance physics\n- scientifically\n- letter\n    - advance in field\n    - open a new\n    - solve a problem\n    - be of great interest\n\n### for authors\n\n- identify audience\n- take-home message\n- adequate literature\n- authorship & acknowledgment\n- additional info\n    - suggested reviewer\n    - conflicts of interest\n    - related paper\n    - PRL/X: justification for suitability exclusively to\n\n## referee\n\n- novel, interesting, original\n- valid and reproducible\n- well presented\n- report\n    - summary\n    - technical details\n    - decision explained\n- report requirements\n    - substantiated\n    - a reasonable level of details\n    - no personal/self-serving remarks\n    - timeliness\n\n### joint submissions\n\n### updated PhySH\n\n## K42: Network Theory and Applications to Complex Systems\n\n### Complex Contagion: Unfolding and Control\n\nAdilson E.

The matrix can be made up of various components such as proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals, and it can be found in different biological contexts, such as bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix surrounding cells.\n> \n> For example, in bone tissue, the extracellular matrix provides support and rigidity to the bone and is primarily composed of collagen fibers and mineralized calcium phosphate. In cartilage, the matrix is composed of collagen and proteoglycans and serves as a cushion between bones in joints. In connective tissue, the matrix provides support and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between cells.\n> \n> In summary, the matrix is an essential component of many biological tissues and provides structural support and a medium for cellular interactions.\n> \n\n### epithelia tissues as hexnematic liquid cystals, and instabilities\n\nHeager et al,  J.

The study uses an active **vertex model** to demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for distinct rotational dynamics. The study also investigates the emergence of chiral symmetry breaking in multicellular systems using experiments and simulations of rotating pancreas spheres. The authors propose that topological defects in the polarity field underlie the symmetry breaking.

However, the corresponding Chinese Wikipedia entry doesn’t cover as much content as the English version, so it’s not entirely a waste of effort.\n\n## Information and Probability\n\nInformation is expressed through a proposition, which can represent multiple propositions through logical operations. This proposition answers a specific question. Before receiving definite information, many other propositions could potentially be answers to this question, making probability theory applicable. Together, all possible propositions form a random variable space.\n\nFor example, in a multiple-choice question with four options, A, B, C, and D:\n- If it’s a single-choice question, the random variable space for the answer is $${A,B,C,D}$$.\n- If it’s multiple-choice, it’s $${A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD}$$, and so on.\n\n## Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\n\n### Self-Information\n\nSelf-information is a property of a random event or a specific possible value of a random variable. It is expressed as:\n\n$$ I(m) = -\\log_n\\left(p(M=m)\\right) $$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, but the logarithm base can vary:\n\n- When $$n=2$$, the unit is called a bit or shannon. A shannon represents the **maximum information** a binary digit can convey.\n- When $$n=e$$, the unit is nat, with loge or $$ln=\\log_e$$ being the natural logarithm.    \n- When $$n=10$$, the unit is hartley.\n\nThe formula is significant in information theory as it represents the minimum number of single-choice questions with nnn options required to find the answer.\n\n### Entropy\n\nEntropy is the overall property of a random variable’s probability distribution. The formula is straightforward, as it’s the expected value of self-information:\n\n$$S(p(M))=\\mathbb{E}_p[-\\log_n p(M)]=-\\sum_{m\\in M}p(m)\\log_n p(m)$$\n\nFor example, binary entropy for a specific random event would be:\n\n$$ S_{binary} = -(1-p)\\log(1-p)-p\\log p $$\n\nEntropy in information theory signifies the minimum number of questions required to equate to the information contained in multiple propositions.\n\n## Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\n\n### Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\n\nAlso known as relative entropy or I-divergence, K-L divergence is defined for two probability distributions of the same random variable space:\n\n$$ D_{KL}(p(X)|q(X))=\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\n\nThis measures the **extra** number of single-choice questions required when using the optimal questions for $$q(X)$$ instead of $$p(X)$$.\n\n### Cross Entropy\n\nCross entropy describes the total number of single-choice questions needed when using the questions optimal for $$q(X)$$ with respect to $$p(X)$$:\n\n$$ CE(p(X),q(X))=-\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log q(x) $$\n\nBinary cross entropy between ppp and qqq can be expressed as:\n\n$$ BCE(p,q)=-p\\log q-(1-p)\\log(1-q) $$\n\n\n### Mutual Information\n\nMutual information, defined for two different random variable spaces, XXX and YYY, is:\n\n$$ MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} $$\n\nThis measures the difference between the joint distribution of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and the assumption that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, with $$MI=0$$ if they are independent.\n\n## Sidebar Discussion\n\n### Loss Functions in PyTorch\n\nSome relevant loss functions in PyTorch are:\n\n- `torch.nn.KLDivLoss`\n- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCELoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`\n\n### Boltzmann’s Epitaph\n\n$$ S=k\\log W $$\n\nHere, $$S$$ is the thermodynamic entropy, $$k$$ is Boltzmann’s constant $$k_B$$, and $$W$$ is the number of microstates. In statistical mechanics, when all states are equally probable, information entropy and thermodynamic entropy differ only by $$k_B$$.\n\n### Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\n\nIn 451 AD, Attila invaded Roman territory and battled a coalition led by Aetius, including Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. Before the battle, Attila consulted a fortune teller who predicted the death of a king and the collapse of a state. Attila assumed Theodoric would fall, but it turned out that while Theodoric did die, the coalition defeated the Huns, and Attila’s ambitions were thwarted.\n\nThis story illustrates how fortune tellers employ low-information predictions that lead people to infer higher-information outcomes, playing on the difference in entropy between statements.\n"}]]]},"__N_SSG":true}
