The matrix can be made up of various components such as proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals, and it can be found in different biological contexts, such as bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix surrounding cells.\n> \n> For example, in bone tissue, the extracellular matrix provides support and rigidity to the bone and is primarily composed of collagen fibers and mineralized calcium phosphate. In cartilage, the matrix is composed of collagen and proteoglycans and serves as a cushion between bones in joints. In connective tissue, the matrix provides support and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between cells.\n> \n> In summary, the matrix is an essential component of many biological tissues and provides structural support and a medium for cellular interactions.\n> \n\n### epithelia tissues as hexnematic liquid cystals, and instabilities\n\nHeager et al,  J.

The study uses an active **vertex model** to demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for distinct rotational dynamics. The study also investigates the emergence of chiral symmetry breaking in multicellular systems using experiments and simulations of rotating pancreas spheres. The authors propose that topological defects in the polarity field underlie the symmetry breaking.

The matrix can be made up of various components such as proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals, and it can be found in different biological contexts, such as bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix surrounding cells.\n> \n> For example, in bone tissue, the extracellular matrix provides support and rigidity to the bone and is primarily composed of collagen fibers and mineralized calcium phosphate. In cartilage, the matrix is composed of collagen and proteoglycans and serves as a cushion between bones in joints. In connective tissue, the matrix provides support and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between cells.\n> \n> In summary, the matrix is an essential component of many biological tissues and provides structural support and a medium for cellular interactions.\n> \n\n### epithelia tissues as hexnematic liquid cystals, and instabilities\n\nHeager et al,  J.

The study uses an active **vertex model** to demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for distinct rotational dynamics. The study also investigates the emergence of chiral symmetry breaking in multicellular systems using experiments and simulations of rotating pancreas spheres. The authors propose that topological defects in the polarity field underlie the symmetry breaking. The article discusses the role of geometry in the behavior and properties of epithelial tissues, including cell division, patterning, and left-right symmetry breaking.\n> \n\n语速还挺快\n\ngeometric constrains \n\n3D上皮 collective dynamics, mouse pancres self organize into a sphere, inside filled with lumen\n\ndistinct rotational modes: rotation, rotation arrest, drift in rotation axis → mechanism?\n\nactive certex model: force balance, polarity dynamics\n\nsolid rotation, or fluid exchange of neighbors. solid body rotation fraction.\n\nrotation axis drift is reminiscent of yielding like transition\n\ncell shape orientation is almost stable, not a uniform random distribution when there is rotation, but uniform random without rotation\n\npolarity dynamics: 2 types of solutions\n\nother structures: cubodal, compact, multi-lumen: **this is the proposed future direction**\n\n## collective behavior\n\n### spying on bacteria in 3d\n\nIsolated cells:\n\nBall pit for E. coli cells for them to tumble \n\nActive hopping and trapping\n\n<hr class=\"slender\">\n\ngranular hydrogel matrix supports 3d printed colonies \n\nCollective motion, not diffusion\n\nConsumption and chemotaxis \n\nHow to keep front together: Change initial position.
