Recently, I needed to study a piece of Python code written by someone else, who specifically requested Python version 3.6. So, I uninstalled the 3.7 version and reinstalled both Python versions 3.9 and 3.6.\n\nI've been trying to encourage my parents to learn programming for a long time, and I owe them a tutorial. Whether it's for those who are committed to continuous improvement in their first programming language or for those who intend to dabble lightly in programming, Python is an excellent choice. So, even though my parents have no interest in programming whatsoever, I still completed this tutorial, hoping it could help others. Since it's aimed at complete beginners, it's based on the Windows 10 operating system. And because I also use this setup myself, based on personal preference, I didn't directly use `conda`.\n\n## Table of Content\n- python\n    - Download `python` interpreter from the official website\n    - Install `python` interpreter\n- Virtual Environment\n    - Set environment variable\n    - Install `virtualenv` with `pip`\n    - Install `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`\n    - Create a virtual env, and install `jupyter`\n- Editor/IDE\n    - Download `vscode` from official website\n    - Install `vscode` and related plugins\n    - Verify it works\n\n## Let's go\n\n### Download `python` interpreter from the official website\n\nDownload from the official website of Python ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-official-website.png)\n\n### Install `python` interpreter\n\nAfter executing the downloaded file, you'll see the interface as shown in the screenshot below. Click on the option highlighted in red box because I want to change the installation path. It seems that you can also check the \"Add Python 3.9 to PATH\" at the bottom. I didn't select it during installation, but later I found out that this step needs to be done manually.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-install.png)\n\nFollowing that, check each option in the next interface, then click \"Next\".\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-next.png)\n\nIn the upcoming interface, select \"Install for all users\" and then choose an installation path you prefer. The reason I choose C:\\Python39 for this location is because:\n\n1. The C drive is the system drive and it's a solid-state drive on my machine, which is faster.\n2. The default path is in the personal folder, which is quite hard to find.\n3. `C:\\Program Files` requires administrator permissions, which is inconvenient for using pip for package management.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-install-path.png)\n\nAfter the installation is complete, open the command prompt and type `py`. You should see a string of Python version information, and then the command prompt will change to `>>>`, indicating that you have entered the Python environment, where you can execute Python commands line by line. Type `exit()` to exit Python.\n\n### Set environment variable\n\nIn the Windows search bar, type \"environment variables,\" and before you finish typing, you should see the suggested result as shown in the image below:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-search.png)\n\nThen, follow the steps in the image below to complete two tasks:\n1. Add two new values, `C:\\Python39` and `C:\\Python39\\Scripts`, to the `Path` variable.\n2. Create a new folder for storing Python virtual environments (such as `C:\\PythonEnvs`). Create a new variable named `WORKON_HOME` and set its value to `C:\\PythonEnvs`.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-box.png)\n\n### Install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`\n\nFollowing the steps just now, `pip` should now be installed. You should see similar feedback in the command line after entering the commands along the way:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-pip-check.png)\n\nIf the command line indicates that `pip` is not found, you may need to reinstall it using the method outlined in [this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py).\n\nType `py -m pip install virtualenv` in the command line to install the virtual environment manager:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenv-install.png)\n\nAfter a successful installation message appears, type `py -m pip install virtualenvwrapper-win` in the command line. The result should be similar to the image above; I forgot to take a screenshot.\n\n### Create a virtual env, and install `jupyter`\n\nAfter installing `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`, enter `mkvirtualenv base` in the command line to create a new virtual environment named base.\n\nThen enter `workon base`. At this point, you should see `(base)` at the beginning of the command prompt, indicating that we are now working within the base virtual environment. Now, when you check `pip --version`, you'll notice that the Python location has changed from before.\n\n![Example Image](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenvwrapper-check.png)\n\nWithin this environment, install Jupyter by typing `pip install jupyter`. While this step is not mandatory, it allows us to have a similar experience to Spyder, which comes with Conda, once we install VSCode. This makes it very convenient for beginners to debug line by line.\n\n### Download and install `vscode`\n\nDownload the installation package from the official website of VS Code ([link here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), where you'll find a prominent download button:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-download.png)\n\nAfter downloading, the installation process is similar to that of any other program (it's been a while, so no screenshots).\n\nOnce installed, open the program and click on the icon outlined in red on the left toolbar, then search for Python-related VS Code plugins. For Python development, you generally need `python`, `pylance`, and `jupyter`:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-plugin.png)\n\nIn the future, when you want to run VS Code, right-click in the folder where you want to start coding and select \"Open with Code\":\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-folder-open.png)\n\nNext, in the VS Code interface, click on the button outlined in red in the file tree to create a new file, name it `*.py`, and here I just wrote something like \"hello.\"\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-new-file.png)\n\nIn the subsequently opened document editing area, type `print(\"Hello World\")`, place the cursor on this line, and press `Shift`+`Enter` to execute this line:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-run.png)\n\nAs it's the first time executing and since `jupyter` is installed, you should see a prompt in the bottom right corner of VS Code asking if you want to execute the code using the Jupyter interactive window. Then close the terminal below (the cross in the top right corner of the bottom half). Press `Shift`+`Enter` again to execute. At this point, the result should look like the image below. Click on the variable explorer in the red circle, and it's almost the same experience as Spyder.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-interactive.png)\n\nIn the future, the Jupyter Interactive Window could be called up by typing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and searching \"interactive\" in the command line that appears on top of the screen.\n"},"tocStr":"{\"index\":null,\"endIndex\":null,\"map\":{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#table-of-content\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Table of Content\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":true,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#lets-go\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Let's go\"}]}]},{\"type\":\"list\",\"ordered\":false,\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#download-python-interpreter-from-the-official-website\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Download \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"python\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\" interpreter from the official website\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#install-python-interpreter\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Install \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"python\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\" interpreter\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#set-environment-variable\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Set environment variable\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#install-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper-with-pip\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Install \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"virtualenv\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\" and \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"virtualenvwrapper\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\" with \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"pip\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#create-a-virtual-env-and-install-jupyter\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Create a virtual env, and install \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"jupyter\"}]}]}]},{\"type\":\"listItem\",\"spread\":false,\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":null,\"url\":\"#download-and-install-vscode\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Download and install \"},{\"type\":\"inlineCode\",\"value\":\"vscode\"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My Python version has been stuck at 3.7 for a while, but now the latest version is already at 3.9.

To make the article flow better, I plan to rearrange the order: first, talk about the editor, then the interpreter, and finally, the virtual environment. Although the article is based on Python, these concepts apply to almost all general-purpose programming languages. Because I'm not from a computer science background, this article is just my study notes, so if there are any inaccuracies, feel free to point them out.\n\n## Editor\n\nFirst, let's do an experiment. Rename the Python file `hello.py` created in the previous tutorial, change the extension `.py` to `.txt`, then double-click to open the file. What happens? In the Windows system, the most ordinary Notepad window pops up, displaying Python statements in black text on a white background, unlike in VSCode where different statements have different colors, but the content is exactly the same.\n\nFurthermore, you can directly execute the content of a `.txt` file in the command line with the Python interpreter (`py -m hello.txt`), with the same effect as `.py`.\n\nThe `.py` extension doesn't do anything special; like a `.txt` file, its content is simply a string of characters readable by humans. Such files are called [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file). An editor is a program that handles text files. Notepad is one type of editor, as is VSCode.\n\nSince Notepad can already write Python code, why bother installing VSCode? Indeed, some people really only use Notepad or other built-in editors of the operating system to write Python code (there's even a video on YouTube of someone writing code in Microsoft Word); then debug the program using the command line. However, VSCode is specifically developed for programmers, providing many features that default editors lack, such as syntax highlighting, which highlights functions, variables, and keywords in different colors.\n\n## Compiler / Interpreter\n\nIn addition to text files, the second type of file mentioned in this article is a [binary file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file).\n\nComputers cannot directly understand characters recognized by humans. At the lowest level, classic computers understand only 0s and 1s represented in different ways. Although all files are ultimately binary at the lowest level, the term \"binary file\" is generally used specifically to refer to files other than text files. Since image files, video files, etc., have their own names, the files referred to by this term are basically related to software programs, files that can be executed by computers.\n\nHumans recognize characters, computers recognize only 0s and 1s, so the most intuitive approach is to translate text files into binary files. This translation process is called [compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), and the software that can accomplish this is called a compiler. Once compilation is complete, the compiler exits, and to execute the program, the computer simply executes the compiled executable file.\n\nHowever, compilation has a problem: the entire software needs to be compiled into a complete executable with all source code text files written. As the scale of the software grows, the resources and time required for compilation increase; once a modification is made, the entire project needs to be recompiled. Many times, we only want to quickly know the effect of a command in a large project; compilation is not suitable for such scenarios.\n\nThus, the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) emerged. This type of program is much more complex than a compiler. It runs whenever we execute a command in a programming language, allowing us to enter commands one by one, remembering the context of the code, and even remembering the results of our previous commands. The cost is that even for large projects, it needs to analyze and interpret line by line, and its computational resource overhead and speed are not as efficient as compilation.\n\nPython is a (official implementation) programming language that uses an interpreter. The `python-***.exe` file we download from the official website is the Python interpreter. This also means that Python programs tend to perform less well than programs written by C/C++ programmers of the same level. However, due to its suitability for trial and error with single-line execution, Python is quite popular in research fields.\n\nOf course, Python's characteristics are far more than just being an interpreted language. It is also:\n- [Scripting language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-choose-python-1-script.html)\n- [Dynamic language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-choose-python-2-dynamic.html)\n- [Object-oriented language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-choose-python-3-oop.html)\n- [Functional programming language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-choose-python-3-oop.html)\n- [...](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-choose-python-5-tools.html)\n\n## Virtual Environment\n\nOnce I asked my girlfriend what IDE she uses to write Python, and she proudly replied that her MacBook comes with Python, so she can run it directly from the command line... The problem wasn't that she didn't answer my question directly (actually, thinking about it, she did answer part of the question), but rather that running the system's built-in Python interpreter or other programming language interpreters or compilers directly from the command line is a dangerous practice common among beginner programmers.\n\nFortunately, Windows is fine; after all, it's an operating system aimed at the general consumer, so it doesn't come with Python pre-installed. However, for more geek-oriented operating systems like Linux and the BSD family, things are different. These operating systems (or their distributions) often come pre-installed with Python. This Python isn't intended for users to develop their own programs but rather for the many system tools written in Python to call upon. Since the version of Python is usually controlled by the package manager of the distribution, it often lags behind the latest Python version for some time to avoid bugs in the new version and to give developers of system tools time to update their code. So, if you use this version of Python for development and accidentally upgrade Python, it's likely to cause some system functionality to malfunction.\n\nA virtual environment is Python's solution to this problem. We can install a version of Python different from the system's default version but not add this interpreter to the system path, so the operating system is unaware of the existence of this version of Python. When creating a virtual environment, we specify the use of this specific version of Python. So, after activating the virtual environment, it becomes the Python we need for development, and exiting the virtual environment returns to the Python used by system tools.\n\nMoreover, even if two projects use the same version of Python and both use the system's default version, virtual environments still have a place. Most programs require dependency onlibrary code written by others, called libraries. Different projects may depend on different library code, or different versions of the same library. In this case, you can create separate virtual environments and install the libraries corresponding to each project. Projects can be isolated from each other.\n\n## Editor + Interpreter / Compiler + Virtual Environment Management + ... = IDE\n\nIt's too cumbersome to install so many different programs for Python development. Can't it be done with just one click? Of course it can. A program that integrates various tools used in the development process is called an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). For Python, the most famous IDE is undoubtedly [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).\n\nThen why don't I use it? Of course, I've used it before, but after hearing about the fame of VSCode and trying it out, I don't want to go back. Writing Python requires editing `.py` files, writing blog posts requires editing `.md` files, and some blog features require JavaScript. Essentially, all these tasks involve editing text files. In an editor like VSCode, everything is done together. So, programs like Spyder and Jupyter Lab in Anaconda seem redundant.\n\n\"Doing one thing well\" is also part of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). But the problem is that different people have different definitions of \"one thing\". Some people think making breakfast is one thing, while others think it involves several things like heating milk, frying eggs, and toasting bread. Who is right?\n\nPerhaps both are right, but Editor + Interpreter + ... is upstream on the chain of contempt compared to IDE. You may disagree with this, but you should know it; otherwise, when others show off, you might feel embarrassed for not being prepared.\n"},{"slug":"python-installation-and-configuration","filename":"2021-03-07-python-installation-and-configuration.md","date":"2021-03-07","title":".py | Setup a Python Dev Environment","layout":"post","keywords":["md"],"excerpt":"Setup a Python dev environment on a Windows machine, using barebone Python, virtualenvwrapper, vscode, and without Conda.","content":"\nMy Python version has been stuck at 3.7 for a while, but now the latest version is already at 3.9.

You should see a string of Python version information, and then the command prompt will change to `>>>`, indicating that you have entered the Python environment, where you can execute Python commands line by line. Type `exit()` to exit Python.\n\n### Set environment variable\n\nIn the Windows search bar, type \"environment variables,\" and before you finish typing, you should see the suggested result as shown in the image below:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-search.png)\n\nThen, follow the steps in the image below to complete two tasks:\n1. Add two new values, `C:\\Python39` and `C:\\Python39\\Scripts`, to the `Path` variable.\n2. Create a new folder for storing Python virtual environments (such as `C:\\PythonEnvs`). Create a new variable named `WORKON_HOME` and set its value to `C:\\PythonEnvs`.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-box.png)\n\n### Install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`\n\nFollowing the steps just now, `pip` should now be installed. You should see similar feedback in the command line after entering the commands along the way:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-pip-check.png)\n\nIf the command line indicates that `pip` is not found, you may need to reinstall it using the method outlined in [this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py).\n\nType `py -m pip install virtualenv` in the command line to install the virtual environment manager:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenv-install.png)\n\nAfter a successful installation message appears, type `py -m pip install virtualenvwrapper-win` in the command line. The result should be similar to the image above; I forgot to take a screenshot.\n\n### Create a virtual env, and install `jupyter`\n\nAfter installing `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`, enter `mkvirtualenv base` in the command line to create a new virtual environment named base.\n\nThen enter `workon base`. At this point, you should see `(base)` at the beginning of the command prompt, indicating that we are now working within the base virtual environment. Now, when you check `pip --version`, you'll notice that the Python location has changed from before.\n\n![Example Image](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenvwrapper-check.png)\n\nWithin this environment, install Jupyter by typing `pip install jupyter`. While this step is not mandatory, it allows us to have a similar experience to Spyder, which comes with Conda, once we install VSCode. This makes it very convenient for beginners to debug line by line.\n\n### Download and install `vscode`\n\nDownload the installation package from the official website of VS Code ([link here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), where you'll find a prominent download button:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-download.png)\n\nAfter downloading, the installation process is similar to that of any other program (it's been a while, so no screenshots).\n\nOnce installed, open the program and click on the icon outlined in red on the left toolbar, then search for Python-related VS Code plugins. For Python development, you generally need `python`, `pylance`, and `jupyter`:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-plugin.png)\n\nIn the future, when you want to run VS Code, right-click in the folder where you want to start coding and select \"Open with Code\":\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-folder-open.png)\n\nNext, in the VS Code interface, click on the button outlined in red in the file tree to create a new file, name it `*.py`, and here I just wrote something like \"hello.\"\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-new-file.png)\n\nIn the subsequently opened document editing area, type `print(\"Hello World\")`, place the cursor on this line, and press `Shift`+`Enter` to execute this line:\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-run.png)\n\nAs it's the first time executing and since `jupyter` is installed, you should see a prompt in the bottom right corner of VS Code asking if you want to execute the code using the Jupyter interactive window. Then close the terminal below (the cross in the top right corner of the bottom half). Press `Shift`+`Enter` again to execute. At this point, the result should look like the image below. Click on the variable explorer in the red circle, and it's almost the same experience as Spyder.\n\n![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-interactive.png)\n\nIn the future, the Jupyter Interactive Window could be called up by typing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and searching \"interactive\" in the command line that appears on top of the screen.\n"}]]]},"__N_SSG":true}
