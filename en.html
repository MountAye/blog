| Compare 2 Probability Distribution or 2 Messages","layout":"post","keywords":["tex","phy","m"],"excerpt":"Translated by ChatGPT.","content":"\n\u003e After feeling self-satisfied for a while, I realized that this article is basically a translation of the English Wikipedia entry Quantities of Information. However, the corresponding Chinese Wikipedia entry doesn’t cover as much content as the English version, so it’s not entirely a waste of effort.\n\n## Information and Probability\n\nInformation is expressed through a proposition, which can represent multiple propositions through logical operations. This proposition answers a specific question. Before receiving definite information, many other propositions could potentially be answers to this question, making probability theory applicable. Together, all possible propositions form a random variable space.\n\nFor example, in a multiple-choice question with four options, A, B, C, and D:\n- If it’s a single-choice question, the random variable space for the answer is $${A,B,C,D}$$.\n- If it’s multiple-choice, it’s $${A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD,ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD,ABCD}$$, and so on.\n\n## Quantifying Information in a Probability Distribution\n\n### Self-Information\n\nSelf-information is a property of a random event or a specific possible value of a random variable. It is expressed as:\n\n$$ I(m) = -\\log_n\\left(p(M=m)\\right) $$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, but the logarithm base can vary:\n\n- When $$n=2$$, the unit is called a bit or shannon. A shannon represents the **maximum information** a binary digit can convey.\n- When $$n=e$$, the unit is nat, with loge or $$ln=\\log_e$$ being the natural logarithm.    \n- When $$n=10$$, the unit is hartley.\n\nThe formula is significant in information theory as it represents the minimum number of single-choice questions with nnn options required to find the answer.\n\n### Entropy\n\nEntropy is the overall property of a random variable’s probability distribution. The formula is straightforward, as it’s the expected value of self-information:\n\n$$S(p(M))=\\mathbb{E}_p[-\\log_n p(M)]=-\\sum_{m\\in M}p(m)\\log_n p(m)$$\n\nFor example, binary entropy for a specific random event would be:\n\n$$ S_{binary} = -(1-p)\\log(1-p)-p\\log p $$\n\nEntropy in information theory signifies the minimum number of questions required to equate to the information contained in multiple propositions.\n\n## Comparing Information Content in Two Probability Distributions\n\n### Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence\n\nAlso known as relative entropy or I-divergence, K-L divergence is defined for two probability distributions of the same random variable space:\n\n$$ D_{KL}(p(X)|q(X))=\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$\n\nThis measures the **extra** number of single-choice questions required when using the optimal questions for $$q(X)$$ instead of $$p(X)$$.\n\n### Cross Entropy\n\nCross entropy describes the total number of single-choice questions needed when using the questions optimal for $$q(X)$$ with respect to $$p(X)$$:\n\n$$ CE(p(X),q(X))=-\\sum_{x\\in X}p(x)\\log q(x) $$\n\nBinary cross entropy between ppp and qqq can be expressed as:\n\n$$ BCE(p,q)=-p\\log q-(1-p)\\log(1-q) $$\n\n\n### Mutual Information\n\nMutual information, defined for two different random variable spaces, XXX and YYY, is:\n\n$$ MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} $$\n\nThis measures the difference between the joint distribution of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and the assumption that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, with $$MI=0$$ if they are independent.\n\n## Sidebar Discussion\n\n### Loss Functions in PyTorch\n\nSome relevant loss functions in PyTorch are:\n\n- `torch.nn.KLDivLoss`\n- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCELoss`\n- `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`\n\n### Boltzmann’s Epitaph\n\n$$ S=k\\log W $$\n\nHere, $$S$$ is the thermodynamic entropy, $$k$$ is Boltzmann’s constant $$k_B$$, and $$W$$ is the number of microstates. In statistical mechanics, when all states are equally probable, information entropy and thermodynamic entropy differ only by $$k_B$$.\n\n### Fortune Telling and Low Information Content\n\nIn 451 AD, Attila invaded Roman territory and battled a coalition led by Aetius, including Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. Before the battle, Attila consulted a fortune teller who predicted the death of a king and the collapse of a state. Attila assumed Theodoric would fall, but it turned out that while Theodoric did die, the coalition defeated the Huns, and Attila’s ambitions were thwarted.\n\nThis story illustrates how fortune tellers employ low-information predictions that lead people to infer higher-information outcomes, playing on the difference in entropy between statements.\n"},{"slug":"python-test-notes","filename":"2023-10-16-python-test-notes.md","date":"2023-10-16","title":".py | Python Testing Notes","layout":"post","keywords":["md","py"],"excerpt":"Translated by ChatGPT.","content":"\n## Some Terms\n\n### Debugging and Testing\n\nDebugging is generally done by the code's author and is used to check the program's execution process for mismatches between thought process and implementation. Debugging code is usually written alongside the main program and includes error handling and logging. Simple debugging can use `print` and `assert` statements, while more complex programs can use the `logging` module.\n\nTesting, on the other hand, is generally done by a third party. The test code is separated from the program code, and the person writing the tests doesn’t need to understand the exact workings of the program—only whether the program produces the declared output given certain inputs.\n\n### Unit Testing\n\nUnit testing is a process that verifies the correctness of a module, function, or class.\n\nThe testing method involves writing a set of test cases, where the tester provides various inputs to the module to check if its output is correct, and also verifies if the program correctly identifies and handles invalid inputs by raising exceptions.\n\nPassing all unit tests doesn’t guarantee that the entire program is error-free, but failing any unit test definitely indicates a problem with the program.\n\n### Documentation Testing\n\nDocumentation provides an overview of a code’s functionality, often with examples that include sample code and expected output. This process is similar to unit testing, except that it's purely descriptive.\n\nDocumentation testing is an automated process that finds example code within the documentation, runs it, and compares the output with the documented results.\n\n### Integration Testing\n\nIntegration testing simulates user behavior by testing the interactions between various modules, ensuring that the program can work properly in a production environment.\n\n## Testing in Python\n\n### File Structure\n\nIn the previous article, I mentioned the `src-layout` structure, which is also discussed in an [official blog post on setuptools](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure). One advantage of this file structure is that the test folder is typically at the same level as `src/` instead of the package itself. This way, you need to install the package in a virtual environment before running the tests, avoiding potential discrepancies between test code and user-downloaded content.\n\n```\n\u003cproject_name\u003e \n├── LICENSE \n├── pyproject.toml \n├── README.md \n├── src/ \n│ └── \u003cpackage_name\u003e/ \n│ ├── init.py \n│ └── example.py \n└── tests/\n```\n\n\n### Unit Testing with `unittest`\n\n`unittest` is Python’s built-in unit testing library.\n\nA basic test script looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestName1(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_sum(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sum([1, 2, 3]), 6, \"Should be 6\")\n\n    def test_sum_tuple(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sum((1, 2, 2)), 6, \"Should be 6\")\n\nclass TestName2(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_sum(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sum([1, 2, 3]), 6, \"Should be 6\")\n\n    def test_sum_tuple(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sum((1, 2, 2)), 6, \"Should be 6\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n- The test cases are wrapped in a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.\n- All test method names begin with \"test\". Limited properties are testable as they use built-in methods prefixed with `self.`. Some of these are in the table below, with `[assertTrue(x)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertTrue)` and `assertRaises(Exception)` being especially versatile.\n- When run as `'__main__'`, it executes the built-in `unittest.main()` function.\n- Running the script requires specifying the script filename in Python. If you install the `nose2` library, you can run `python -m nose2`, which will automatically discover and execute all tests. (`unittest` also seems to have an automatic discovery feature.)\n\n### Documentation Testing\n\nhttps://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/1016959663602400/1017605739507840\n\nPython's documentation testing uses the `doctest` library, as shown below:\n\n```python\nclass Dict(dict):\n    '''\n    Simple dict but also supports access as x.y style.\n\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d1 = Dict()\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d1['x'] = 100\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d1.x\n    100\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d1.y = 200\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d1['y']\n    200\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d2 = Dict(a=1, b=2, c='3')\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d2.c\n    '3'\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d2['empty']\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n        ...\n    KeyError: 'empty'\n    \u003e\u003e\u003e d2.empty\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n        ...\n    AttributeError: 'Dict' object has no attribute 'empty'\n    '''\n    def __init__(self, **kw):\n        super(Dict, self).__init__(**kw)\n\n    def __getattr__(self, key):\n        try:\n            return self[key]\n        except KeyError:\n            raise AttributeError(r\"'Dict' object has no attribute '%s'\" % key)\n\n    def __setattr__(self, key, value):\n        self[key] = value\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import doctest\n    doctest.testmod()\n```\n\nWith `docstring` indentation preserved, lines beginning with `\u003e\u003e\u003e` are treated as tests, with the following lines as expected outputs. For expected errors, you can use `...` to omit intermediate error details.\n\nIntegration Testing\n\nYou can also use unittest for integration testing.\n\nThe main difference from unit testing is that integration tests often involve setting up a test dataset. This requires overriding unittest.TestCase.setup().\n\n```python\nclass TestComplexData(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # load test data\n        self.app = App(database='fixtures/test_complex.json')\n\n    def test_customer_count(self):\n        self.assertEqual(len(self.app.customers), 10000)\n\n    def test_existence_of_customer(self):\n        customer = self.app.get_customer(id=9999)\n        self.assertEqual(customer.name, u\"バナナ\")\n        self.assertEqual(customer.address, \"10 Red Road, Akihabara, Tokyo\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n"},{"slug":"python-packaging","filename":"2023-10-13-python-packaging.md","date":"2023-10-13","title":".py | Making Your Code Usable by Others","layout":"post","keywords":["md","py"],"excerpt":"Translated by ChatGPT.","content":"\n\u003e Here, \"others\" also includes the version of yourself six months later, who may no longer remember how this code was written.\n\nSome time ago, I wrote an article called [**Using Import to Reference Existing Code**](https://mountaye.github.io/blog/articles/python-import-script-module-package), which explained how to use code written by others. I briefly mentioned a module's `setup.py` file at the end but didn’t go further. Now, let’s continue.\n\n- [https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)\n- [https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html)\n\n## Basic Process\n\n- Write your code and structure the project files in a specific way (see next section).\n- According to your project structure, fill in a `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, **or** `setup.py` **file**.\n- Install the `build` library, then run `python -m build` to create a `dist/` folder with your built files. Optionally, upload the project to PyPi or Conda.\n\n## Project File Structure\n\nCommon file structures include the src-layout and flat-layout. Some small projects consist of a single Python file.\n\n### src-layout\n\nIn the src-layout, the folder containing the package source code has another folder above it, typically named `src` (although it could be named differently). The `pyproject.toml` file is on the same level as the `src/` folder.\n\n```\n\u003cproject_name\u003e \n    ├── LICENSE \n    ├── pyproject.toml \n    ├── README.md \n    ├── src/ \n    │   └── \u003cpackage_name\u003e/\n    │   ├── init.py \n    │   └── example.py \n    └── tests/\n```\n\n### flat-layout\n\nIn a flat-layout, the folder containing the package source code is directly under the top level of the project, on the same level as `pyproject.toml`.\n\nThis structure is older and not generally recommended.\n\n```\n\u003cproject_name\u003e \n    ├── pyproject.toml # and/or setup.cfg/setup.py\n    ├── \u003cpackage_name\u003e \n    |   ├── init.py \n    |   └── ... (other Python files) \n    ├── test \n    |   └── ... (test files) \n    ├── README.md \n    └── LICENSE \n```\n\n\n### Single-File Project\n\nThis can be considered a special case of flat-layout.\n\n```\n\u003cproject_name\u003e \n    ├── pyproject.toml # and/or setup.cfg/setup.py \n    ├── \u003cmy_module\u003e.py \n    ├── README.rst or README.md \n    └── LICENSE\n```\n\n\n## Filling in `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, **or** `setup.py` **File**\n\nTo package your code into an installable package, at least one of these three files must appear in the project root.\n\nThe file must contain project information in the syntax specific to its extension, most of which is self-explanatory.\n\nKey parameters, such as `name`, `packages`, and `package_dir`, are based on the file structure. If the file structure fully follows the structure outlined in the previous section, then [automatic discovery](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#automatic-discovery) with `setuptools.find_packages()` should suffice.\n\n### `name`\n\nThis is a required parameter.\n\nNote: In the file structure from the previous section, there are two names: `\u003cproject_name\u003e` and `\u003cpackage_name\u003e`.\n\n- `\u003cproject_name\u003e` is the name of the development project as a whole. If you are using a version control system like git, this is the name of your repository.\n- `\u003cpackage_name\u003e` can—but doesn’t have to—be the name you import in other code. This import name is specified by the `name` parameter in `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` **/** `setup.py`. It cannot contain hyphens and can only use underscores.\n\nIf your `name` parameter differs from `\u003cpackage_name\u003e`, you must also set the `package_dir` parameter.\n\nThere is also a third name: the one used for `pip install __` when uploaded to PyPI. This name can contain hyphens, like `scikit-image`.\n\n### `packages`\n\nThis parameter is a list, but it typically takes the result of `setuptools.find_packages()`.\n\nThe `find_packages()` function commonly accepts three optional parameters:\n\n- `where`: A path relative to `setup.py`\n- `include`: A list of glob patterns\n- `exclude`: A list of glob patterns\n\nLeaving all parameters blank uses automatic discovery.\n\n### `package_dir`\n\nThis parameter is a dictionary with two main uses:\n\n- In a standard src-layout, simply write `{\"\": \"src/\"}`, indicating that all code is within this folder.\n- If the Python module structure differs from the code file structure, use this dictionary to define the mapping between modules and folders.\n\nFile paths are relative to `setup.py`.\n\n### `py_modules`\n\nThis parameter is a list of file paths, mostly used for single-file structures.\n\n## Building and Uploading\n\nInstall the build tool: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`\n\nRun the build: `python3 -m build`\n\nThis will create a `dist/` folder containing the build files.\n\nTo allow others to install your program using `pip install`, you need to upload the build to PyPI.

This is called static installation.\n\n### Dynamic Installation\n\nFor packages still under development, run `pip install -e .` in the directory containing `setup.py`. This is called dynamic installation because changes in the code are reflected in the referencing projects in real time.\n\n## Exercises\n\nHere is the file structure of a [data analysis project](https://gist.github.com/ericmjl/27e50331f24db3e8f957d1fe7bbbe510), slightly modified:\n\n```\n/path/to/project/directory/ \n    |-- notebooks/ \n        |-- 01-first-logical-notebook.ipynb \n        |-- 02-second-logical-notebook.ipynb \n        |-- prototype-notebook.ipynb \n        |-- archive/ \n            |-- no-longer-useful.ipynb \n    |-- src/ \n        |-- projectname/ \n            |-- init.py \n            |-- config.py \n            |-- data.py \n            |-- utils.py \n            |-- setup.py \n    |-- README.md \n    |-- data/ \n    |-- raw/ \n    |-- processed/ \n    |-- cleaned/ \n    |-- scripts/ \n        |-- script1.py \n        |-- script2.py \n        |-- archive/ \n            |-- no-longer-useful.py \n    |-- environment.yml\n```\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.

It quickly worsened into herpes zoster, commonly known as \"internal heat\" in Chinese medicine. The second semester of the American academic year ends in May, and I haven't made much progress on my thesis. I can't find a job, and the application season for postdoctoral programs is in full swing with paper submissions. I watched helplessly as the application deadlines for two projects passed by. The postdoctoral project shared by a neighboring research group reposted their job advertisement online shortly after I submitted my application materials. I also applied to two research institutes in Germany, with one already sending a rejection letter and the other not responding at all. In addition to all this, I need to prepare for my presentation at the conference. It's no wonder I'm feeling stressed.\n\nOn Friday, we had a rehearsal for the group's presentations. I had initially planned to reuse the slides from last year's conference but realized that the main content from my paper was missing. It made me realize that I had indeed accomplished quite a bit over the past year. After receiving the rejection letter from the German research institute, I felt down for a day. However, the trend of using ChatGPT quickly gained popularity. So I compiled a list of professors I had heard of during my doctoral studies and fed their research group homepage descriptions, along with an abstract of my paper generated by AI, to ChatGPT, asking it to compose an email. The result was decent, and I received a reply inviting me to meet during the conference. The person who responded is a well-known researcher who studies animal behavior using a cross-scale approach and manages two research groups in Europe and East Asia. They made a big impression at last year's conference and later came to give a lecture at my university. We had lunch together. Shortly before the meeting, someone on the APS (American Physical Society) mailing list sent a mass email advertising a job opportunity. It turns out they are the current postdoc who will soon start a faculty position at a university in the western United States. Interestingly, they are currently working at the German research institute that rejected me. I can't help but feel a mix of envy and satisfaction knowing that they also fell for the ChatGPT-generated email trick.\n\n### Meeting\n\nI walked to the conference venue and checked in. I received a name tag, which was just a thick piece of paper hanging from a string, without even a plastic cover.\n\nAfter checking in, I surveyed the layout of the conference venue. The rooms related to biophysics were located on both sides of the first intersection in the main corridor. Each doorway had display boards indicating the themes of the speeches for each time slot. Unlike last year when I was the only one from our team attending, this year all three members of our team have presentations. In addition, Katie, a former master's student in our group, and her current classmates also have presentations. When I marked the schedule, I found that most of the interesting sessions conflicted with each other. Although I have social anxiety, I still feel that interpersonal relationships are important. Or perhaps it's because of my social anxiety that I feel interpersonal relationships are more important?\n\nBack at the hotel, I received a reply from my group email to confirm a time one or two weeks after the March meeting for a remote interview. The purpose is for me to introduce my current work and explain how I can contribute to his laboratory. It's a bit unexpected because his group email mentioned that he would attend the conference, and my email also stated that I was willing to meet during the conference. Does this reply imply a lack of interest? I feel a little disappointed.\n\n### Interview 1\n\nWhen I was wandering between different sub-venues and arrived late to one where the seats were already filled, I had to stand at the back. While I was standing and listening in one of the venues, a guy wearing a green jacket and carrying a sports backpack walked in. He listened for a while and then left. He seemed somewhat familiar, resembling the photos on ChatGPT's personal website.\n\nCurious, I discreetly left the venue and saw him talking to a friend in the corridor, with the name tag on the front of his chest turned over. I temporarily left and explored around, discovering that coffee was available in the main corridor. I lined up and got a cup, then came back to investigate and confirmed it was him.\n\nI greeted him, and it turned out that ChatGPT had been too verbose in his email and only mentioned that he was also attending the conference in March at the very end. I asked him when my presentation was scheduled and if he planned to attend, so we wouldn't need a Zoom meeting.\n\nThe title of my presentation during that time slot was quite peculiar, and it didn't seem to have much relevance to what I was working on. When I entered the waiting area, I noticed that apart from the two of us from our lab, all the other presentations in that session were focused on the same pattern and structure of a particular model organism. Our presentation came at the very end of the session, and I felt we performed well. When I started addressing the topic, I made a joke using the session's title, and we finished right on time. ChatGPT arrived at the venue about half an hour before my presentation, and after we finished, he left without coming up to talk to me.\n\nAfterward, back at the hotel, I received an email from him, inviting me to meet the next afternoon. I searched his schedule on the conference website and found that it was right after his presentation. Looking at the title of his talk, it seemed to be about his recent paper. I fed the article into an AI tool to generate an abstract but didn't get a chance to read it before my classmates pulled me away to play...\n\nHis presentation was scheduled for the next afternoon and fell in the middle of the overall time slot. I entered the venue at the beginning of the session, and he arrived a little later, sat for a while, and then left. The venue was twice as large as when I gave my presentation, but it wasn't completely filled. While he was speaking, I was reviewing the article summary generated by AI from yesterday, feeling that it contained more information than most of the presentations I had heard up until that point. His presentation skills were also far above the average level. His research targeted a biological system one level higher than my current research focus, but the approach and process seemed similar. His research was much more advanced, both in theory and experimentation. Although the theory seemed to be a fairly traditional model in the field, it was still much better than just presenting experimental data like we did.\n\nAfter the conference, we met in the corridor and found two seats. I showed him my slides, and he went through all the details, confirming that I would be working on gene editing in our lab's model organism. He also asked about the proportion of my work within the entire project.\n\nThen, he asked a question that felt as significant as being confessed to in a romantic relationship: \"What is the central question guiding your research career?\" Ah, my brain immediately crashed. Seeing me struggling, the guy said I could speak in Chinese, as he understood it but couldn't speak it. Finally, when I felt cornered, I told the truth - I just wanted to coast through academia, eat and wait for death. If\n\n ChatGPT has arrived, and we have super-intelligent AI, who needs physics anymore? Physics doesn't exist anymore. The guy chuckled at my response.\n\nHe then asked me to ask questions. I inquired about the duration of holidays, and he replied that it followed the school's policy. Those who have cultured cells should know that they might have to go to the school on weekends, so as long as the workload is sufficient, there are no attendance requirements on weekdays.\n\nOverall, the conversation went quite smoothly. In the end, he mentioned that he would send me an email and asked for two or three ways to contact me, as well as a recommendation letter.\n\n### Interview 2\n\nOriginally, I had a good impression of this esteemed person, but since it was the first day of the conference, I thought maybe everyone hadn't settled in yet. Therefore, I sent an email on Tuesday to confirm the meeting time, and as a result, we arranged to meet on Friday at noon, next to the DBIO service desk.\n\nI had planned to prepare in advance, as his research group had three or four presentations, but most of them clashed with my own presentation or the previous interview. In the end, I only attended one of them.\n\nFriday at noon turned out to be the last session of the entire conference. The DBIO table had already been removed, and everyone seemed eager to leave. After about ten minutes past 12 o'clock, I finally met the person, and five minutes later, the person I was talking to left. Everyone was busy packing up and closing the doors. We found an empty room with a table and chairs that had already been moved out. Inside the room, there was only one student lying on the floor sleeping. The two of us sat down facing each other on the floor.\n\nJust as I was about to take out my computer to go over my presentation, he waved his hand and asked me to briefly summarize my work orally. The subsequent series of questions and answers followed the same style, with the two of us sitting on the floor, exchanging rapid-fire questions and quick responses, resembling the agility of Zen. He started by asking why I chose to pursue my current work. I thought I gave a decent answer, but as I spoke, I realized that it was the answer from the previous interview. Why didn't I think of that earlier? Feeling a bit too pleased with myself, I forgot that this esteemed person was focused on studying behavior, not organizational structure. It could have been easily smoothed over, but I didn't handle it well. Then he asked about my favorite course during my undergraduate studies, a question he mentioned during our lunch break, so I pretended to be impressive. After that, he asked two significant questions: \"How did a stinky experimenter like you end up begging for food in our theoretical group?\" and \"How did a stinky structuralist like you end up begging for food in our behavioral research field?\" I didn't answer them well. Earlier, in my self-satisfaction, I mentioned having another job offer, which led to both sides being somewhat perfunctory during the latter part of the conversation.\n\nFinally, he briefed me that the research in East Asia has sufficient funding, although he spends a considerable amount of time there every year, it's not always possible to meet in person for guidance. Regarding Europe, if I decide to join, he would need to specifically apply for funding. The meaning behind this was quite clear, so we politely agreed to take some time to consider it and said we could stay in touch via email in the future.\n\n### Symposium\n\nThe symposium actually took place on the afternoon of the same day as my speech, right before the two interviews.\n\nThe so-called symposium was organized by several research institutions in Germany and aimed to promote information related to research conducted in Germany. It was quite far from the venues of the biophysics sessions. After my friend Katie finished her speech, I slipped out of the venue and rushed over. By the time I arrived, it had already begun. There were bagels, jam, and cheese on both sides of the entrance, and it was the first time in many days that I had lunch.\n\nThere were six or seven round tables in the venue, each with a small label indicating the name of a research institution. There were one or two staff members from each corresponding institute sitting at the tables. The host introduced each research institution in turn and gave the leaders of the institutions three to five minutes to introduce themselves. After that, it was free time. I noticed that the Max Planck Institute's table was near the bread, and since the other institutions didn't seem to focus much on basic scientific research, I found a chair and sat down. The head of the Max Planck Institute was an elder with white hair. His attire was more formal compared to the other participants, and he had a strong presence, resembling a wise figure.\n\nThe first question was about the difficulty of immigrating to Germany and whether Germany was somewhat exclusive. The elder replied that Germany is currently one of the most open countries in terms of immigration policies. Considering the phrase \"one of the,\" and also taking into account that foreign graduates in non-academic positions in the beacon country have to draw lots to obtain a work visa, excluding the \"borderline,\" this answer could not be considered wrong. Deutsche Welle had previously released a video with a similar statement, but that video had a follow-up phrase of \"aber...\" (but...).\n\nSomeone then asked about the projects and job structure at the Max Planck Institute. The answer was similar to what I had previously understood. Each research institution has the authority to recruit its own researchers. The duration of a postdoctoral position is generally two years, with extensions to three years or longer only when necessary. At the Max Planck Institute, except for the director, there are hardly any permanent positions for research positions. The institute serves as a stepping stone for researchers before they secure a permanent faculty position. However, whether it was a government regulation or something else, there was a rule stating that nine years after obtaining a doctoral degree, the employing institution must provide a permanent position. As a result, individuals are often dismissed before the end of those nine years. It wasn't asked whether this contradicted the previous answer.\n\nWhen asked what kind of research the Max Planck Institute favors, the elder explicitly stated that they prefer more challenging and ambitious topics rather than safe topics pursued solely to obtain a faculty position. He even specifically mentioned the aim to explore topics and scholars that have the potential to receive Nobel Prizes in the future. This naturally differs from the American-style notion of verbal freedom and the actual practice of focusing on safe bets. It's interesting how the understanding of pragmatism can differ so greatly between two cultures—one rooted in long-term plans and top-down designs, and the other more focused on short-term gains.\n\nSomeone also asked about the criteria for selecting applicants at the Max Planck Institute. The answer was that each research institution has its own criteria. However, he also mentioned his own criteria: academic performance is the main factor, and when conducting research, one should have a clear understanding of the underlying physics. So, how is academic performance judged? It mainly depends on attending prestigious schools, followed by academic rankings. If the school's name is less well-known, higher academic rankings are expected. The answer was sincere, and it didn't evoke any sense of objection towards such obvious discrimination based on one's undergraduate alma mater, nor did it provoke any intention to challenge it.\n\nThis response is clearly targeting the American model, which emphasizes research experience and places greater importance on the authorship of papers. The backbone of a research group consists of Ph.D. students who do not need to spend time attending classes. How much contribution can undergraduate students applying for a Ph.D. make to the entire project? Moreover, these contributions are largely made by sacrificing their efforts in coursework. The sentence highlighted above is a sarcastic comment on this matter. Furthermore, considering the notorious reputation of the academic environment in China, overseas research experience is typically required. Apart from special programs like the Everest Plan that provide scholarships, most students have to self-fund and contact foreign mentors. This not only turns academic selection into a disparity unrelated to academia, linked instead to students' economic conditions, but also fosters an intermediary industry that sells such information. What academic justice is there in this policy?\n\nHowever, let's consider how much academic performance can be reflected in a transcript. How many students openly ask their professors for grades when they intend to study abroad? Until a few years ago, there were even legitimate operations like \"passing and retaking\" courses at certain universities to alter transcripts. Not to mention the highly similar nature of examination questions across different subjects in China, which is detrimental to stability and unity. If attending prestigious schools is a requirement, then going abroad after high school graduation has far more advantages than going after undergraduate studies. It becomes a class-based filtering process, leading to the same destination through different paths.\n\nBoth of these scenarios involve individuals, each operating under a different moral framework, which is gradually deconstructed and distorted when translated into executable actions. Throughout this process, their own judgment is constantly outsourced. Outsourcing itself is not a problem, as division of labor is both a reflection of societal development and an important driving force. However, let's take an airplane as an example. Safely delivering passengers to their destinations requires coordination and trust between the crew and ground staff, but the safe arrival ultimately has objective standards. In the education and research system, the outcomes of its own cultivation are digested by itself. The selection process inherently involves the phenomenon of athletes acting as both players and referees. Some of the selected individuals may not be competent, while some of the non-selected ones may be capable. In that case, it would be straightforward: allocate all resources to the winners and cut off the paths for the losers...\n\nBoth models, in their mediocrity, peck at each other, and neither can replace the other. Ultimately, today's physics itself is lackluster. Leaving aside the magnificent breakthroughs during the birth of quantum mechanics and relativity, even the process of constructing the standard model was full of ad hoc solutions. Today, it is difficult to hope for its complete reversal. How much of the knowledge you solidly understand can be applied in your actual research? How many valuable works have you produced over these years of early involvement in research? Young people consider matters they believe are crucial to their future and destiny, but it is nothing more than a few bytes in their boss's email inbox. Whether they accept you or someone else, the difference is insignificant.\n\nIn short, there are no heroes in our time, which allows mediocre individuals to gain fame.\n\nIn the afternoon, a lady who had a conversation with \"群发哥\" (a nickname) the day before gave a speech shortly after him. Looking at her organization on the first page of the presentation slides, it seemed that she was a junior colleague in his doctoral laboratory and was about to join his current research institute. ~~In other words, she is the enemy who took away my offer~~. So, I posted a complaint in my friend circle. Her speech exceeded the allotted time and was interrupted by the host. I was about to\n\n add a comment saying \"Exceeded the time, so bad,\" but considering that I had been posting quite a lot on my friend circle in the past few days, I refrained.\n\nThe only person I admired during my four years in university, \"峰神\" (a nickname), replied below, saying he had also considered applying to the same research institute. I asked him where he is now, and a few minutes later, I saw his reply: \"Already started working.\" I quickly teased him, saying \"Rich brother, lend me 50 yuan.\" However, the words spoken at the meeting reverberated in my mind, sighing and turning into a deep breath. I silently put away my phone.\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/en","query":{},"buildId":"buildID","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
