            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
### Before the Meeting

The March meeting will be held in Las Vegas this year.

It's about two weeks away from the conference, and I developed folliculitis at the base of my chin where I have a beard. It quickly worsened into herpes zoster, commonly known as "internal heat" in Chinese medicine. The second semester of the American academic year ends in May, and I haven't made much progress on my thesis. I can't find a job, and the application season for postdoctoral programs is in full swing with paper submissions. I watched helplessly as the application deadlines for two projects passed by. The postdoctoral project shared by a neighboring research group reposted their job advertisement online shortly after I submitted my application materials. I also applied to two research institutes in Germany, with one already sending a rejection letter and the other not responding at all. In addition to all this, I need to prepare for my presentation at the conference. It's no wonder I'm feeling stressed.

On Friday, we had a rehearsal for the group's presentations. I had initially planned to reuse the slides from last year's conference but realized that the main content from my paper was missing. It made me realize that I had indeed accomplished quite a bit over the past year. After receiving the rejection letter from the German research institute, I felt down for a day. However, the trend of using ChatGPT quickly gained popularity. So I compiled a list of professors I had heard of during my doctoral studies and fed their research group homepage descriptions, along with an abstract of my paper generated by AI, to ChatGPT, asking it to compose an email. The result was decent, and I received a reply inviting me to meet during the conference. The person who responded is a well-known researcher who studies animal behavior using a cross-scale approach and manages two research groups in Europe and East Asia. They made a big impression at last year's conference and later came to give a lecture at my university. We had lunch together. Shortly before the meeting, someone on the APS (American Physical Society) mailing list sent a mass email advertising a job opportunity. It turns out they are the current postdoc who will soon start a faculty position at a university in the western United States. Interestingly, they are currently working at the German research institute that rejected me. I can't help but feel a mix of envy and satisfaction knowing that they also fell for the ChatGPT-generated email trick.

### Meeting

I walked to the conference venue and checked in. I received a name tag, which was just a thick piece of paper hanging from a string, without even a plastic cover.

After checking in, I surveyed the layout of the conference venue. The rooms related to biophysics were located on both sides of the first intersection in the main corridor. Each doorway had display boards indicating the themes of the speeches for each time slot. Unlike last year when I was the only one from our team attending, this year all three members of our team have presentations. In addition, Katie, a former master's student in our group, and her current classmates also have presentations. When I marked the schedule, I found that most of the interesting sessions conflicted with each other. Although I have social anxiety, I still feel that interpersonal relationships are important. Or perhaps it's because of my social anxiety that I feel interpersonal relationships are more important?

Back at the hotel, I received a reply from my group email to confirm a time one or two weeks after the March meeting for a remote interview. The purpose is for me to introduce my current work and explain how I can contribute to his laboratory. It's a bit unexpected because his group email mentioned that he would attend the conference, and my email also stated that I was willing to meet during the conference. Does this reply imply a lack of interest? I feel a little disappointed.

### Interview 1

When I was wandering between different sub-venues and arrived late to one where the seats were already filled, I had to stand at the back. While I was standing and listening in one of the venues, a guy wearing a green jacket and carrying a sports backpack walked in. He listened for a while and then left. He seemed somewhat familiar, resembling the photos on ChatGPT's personal website.

Curious, I discreetly left the venue and saw him talking to a friend in the corridor, with the name tag on the front of his chest turned over. I temporarily left and explored around, discovering that coffee was available in the main corridor. I lined up and got a cup, then came back to investigate and confirmed it was him.

I greeted him, and it turned out that ChatGPT had been too verbose in his email and only mentioned that he was also attending the conference in March at the very end. I asked him when my presentation was scheduled and if he planned to attend, so we wouldn't need a Zoom meeting.

The title of my presentation during that time slot was quite peculiar, and it didn't seem to have much relevance to what I was working on. When I entered the waiting area, I noticed that apart from the two of us from our lab, all the other presentations in that session were focused on the same pattern and structure of a particular model organism. Our presentation came at the very end of the session, and I felt we performed well. When I started addressing the topic, I made a joke using the session's title, and we finished right on time. ChatGPT arrived at the venue about half an hour before my presentation, and after we finished, he left without coming up to talk to me.

Afterward, back at the hotel, I received an email from him, inviting me to meet the next afternoon. I searched his schedule on the conference website and found that it was right after his presentation. Looking at the title of his talk, it seemed to be about his recent paper. I fed the article into an AI tool to generate an abstract but didn't get a chance to read it before my classmates pulled me away to play...

His presentation was scheduled for the next afternoon and fell in the middle of the overall time slot. I entered the venue at the beginning of the session, and he arrived a little later, sat for a while, and then left. The venue was twice as large as when I gave my presentation, but it wasn't completely filled. While he was speaking, I was reviewing the article summary generated by AI from yesterday, feeling that it contained more information than most of the presentations I had heard up until that point. His presentation skills were also far above the average level. His research targeted a biological system one level higher than my current research focus, but the approach and process seemed similar. His research was much more advanced, both in theory and experimentation. Although the theory seemed to be a fairly traditional model in the field, it was still much better than just presenting experimental data like we did.

After the conference, we met in the corridor and found two seats. I showed him my slides, and he went through all the details, confirming that I would be working on gene editing in our lab's model organism. He also asked about the proportion of my work within the entire project.

Then, he asked a question that felt as significant as being confessed to in a romantic relationship: "What is the central question guiding your research career?" Ah, my brain immediately crashed. Seeing me struggling, the guy said I could speak in Chinese, as he understood it but couldn't speak it. Finally, when I felt cornered, I told the truth - I just wanted to coast through academia, eat and wait for death. If

 ChatGPT has arrived, and we have super-intelligent AI, who needs physics anymore? Physics doesn't exist anymore. The guy chuckled at my response.

He then asked me to ask questions. I inquired about the duration of holidays, and he replied that it followed the school's policy. Those who have cultured cells should know that they might have to go to the school on weekends, so as long as the workload is sufficient, there are no attendance requirements on weekdays.

Overall, the conversation went quite smoothly. In the end, he mentioned that he would send me an email and asked for two or three ways to contact me, as well as a recommendation letter.

### Interview 2

Originally, I had a good impression of this esteemed person, but since it was the first day of the conference, I thought maybe everyone hadn't settled in yet. Therefore, I sent an email on Tuesday to confirm the meeting time, and as a result, we arranged to meet on Friday at noon, next to the DBIO service desk.

I had planned to prepare in advance, as his research group had three or four presentations, but most of them clashed with my own presentation or the previous interview. In the end, I only attended one of them.

Friday at noon turned out to be the last session of the entire conference. The DBIO table had already been removed, and everyone seemed eager to leave. After about ten minutes past 12 o'clock, I finally met the person, and five minutes later, the person I was talking to left. Everyone was busy packing up and closing the doors. We found an empty room with a table and chairs that had already been moved out. Inside the room, there was only one student lying on the floor sleeping. The two of us sat down facing each other on the floor.

Just as I was about to take out my computer to go over my presentation, he waved his hand and asked me to briefly summarize my work orally. The subsequent series of questions and answers followed the same style, with the two of us sitting on the floor, exchanging rapid-fire questions and quick responses, resembling the agility of Zen. He started by asking why I chose to pursue my current work. I thought I gave a decent answer, but as I spoke, I realized that it was the answer from the previous interview. Why didn't I think of that earlier? Feeling a bit too pleased with myself, I forgot that this esteemed person was focused on studying behavior, not organizational structure. It could have been easily smoothed over, but I didn't handle it well. Then he asked about my favorite course during my undergraduate studies, a question he mentioned during our lunch break, so I pretended to be impressive. After that, he asked two significant questions: "How did a stinky experimenter like you end up begging for food in our theoretical group?" and "How did a stinky structuralist like you end up begging for food in our behavioral research field?" I didn't answer them well. Earlier, in my self-satisfaction, I mentioned having another job offer, which led to both sides being somewhat perfunctory during the latter part of the conversation.

Finally, he briefed me that the research in East Asia has sufficient funding, although he spends a considerable amount of time there every year, it's not always possible to meet in person for guidance. Regarding Europe, if I decide to join, he would need to specifically apply for funding. The meaning behind this was quite clear, so we politely agreed to take some time to consider it and said we could stay in touch via email in the future.

### Symposium

The symposium actually took place on the afternoon of the same day as my speech, right before the two interviews.

The so-called symposium was organized by several research institutions in Germany and aimed to promote information related to research conducted in Germany. It was quite far from the venues of the biophysics sessions. After my friend Katie finished her speech, I slipped out of the venue and rushed over. By the time I arrived, it had already begun. There were bagels, jam, and cheese on both sides of the entrance, and it was the first time in many days that I had lunch.

There were six or seven round tables in the venue, each with a small label indicating the name of a research institution. There were one or two staff members from each corresponding institute sitting at the tables. The host introduced each research institution in turn and gave the leaders of the institutions three to five minutes to introduce themselves. After that, it was free time. I noticed that the Max Planck Institute's table was near the bread, and since the other institutions didn't seem to focus much on basic scientific research, I found a chair and sat down. The head of the Max Planck Institute was an elder with white hair. His attire was more formal compared to the other participants, and he had a strong presence, resembling a wise figure.

The first question was about the difficulty of immigrating to Germany and whether Germany was somewhat exclusive. The elder replied that Germany is currently one of the most open countries in terms of immigration policies. Considering the phrase "one of the," and also taking into account that foreign graduates in non-academic positions in the beacon country have to draw lots to obtain a work visa, excluding the "borderline," this answer could not be considered wrong. Deutsche Welle had previously released a video with a similar statement, but that video had a follow-up phrase of "aber..." (but...).

Someone then asked about the projects and job structure at the Max Planck Institute. The answer was similar to what I had previously understood. Each research institution has the authority to recruit its own researchers. The duration of a postdoctoral position is generally two years, with extensions to three years or longer only when necessary. At the Max Planck Institute, except for the director, there are hardly any permanent positions for research positions. The institute serves as a stepping stone for researchers before they secure a permanent faculty position. However, whether it was a government regulation or something else, there was a rule stating that nine years after obtaining a doctoral degree, the employing institution must provide a permanent position. As a result, individuals are often dismissed before the end of those nine years. It wasn't asked whether this contradicted the previous answer.

When asked what kind of research the Max Planck Institute favors, the elder explicitly stated that they prefer more challenging and ambitious topics rather than safe topics pursued solely to obtain a faculty position. He even specifically mentioned the aim to explore topics and scholars that have the potential to receive Nobel Prizes in the future. This naturally differs from the American-style notion of verbal freedom and the actual practice of focusing on safe bets. It's interesting how the understanding of pragmatism can differ so greatly between two cultures—one rooted in long-term plans and top-down designs, and the other more focused on short-term gains.

Someone also asked about the criteria for selecting applicants at the Max Planck Institute. The answer was that each research institution has its own criteria. However, he also mentioned his own criteria: academic performance is the main factor, and when conducting research, one should have a clear understanding of the underlying physics. So, how is academic performance judged? It mainly depends on attending prestigious schools, followed by academic rankings. If the school's name is less well-known, higher academic rankings are expected. The answer was sincere, and it didn't evoke any sense of objection towards such obvious discrimination based on one's undergraduate alma mater, nor did it provoke any intention to challenge it.

This response is clearly targeting the American model, which emphasizes research experience and places greater importance on the authorship of papers. The backbone of a research group consists of Ph.D. students who do not need to spend time attending classes. How much contribution can undergraduate students applying for a Ph.D. make to the entire project? Moreover, these contributions are largely made by sacrificing their efforts in coursework. The sentence highlighted above is a sarcastic comment on this matter. Furthermore, considering the notorious reputation of the academic environment in China, overseas research experience is typically required. Apart from special programs like the Everest Plan that provide scholarships, most students have to self-fund and contact foreign mentors. This not only turns academic selection into a disparity unrelated to academia, linked instead to students' economic conditions, but also fosters an intermediary industry that sells such information. What academic justice is there in this policy?

However, let's consider how much academic performance can be reflected in a transcript. How many students openly ask their professors for grades when they intend to study abroad? Until a few years ago, there were even legitimate operations like "passing and retaking" courses at certain universities to alter transcripts. Not to mention the highly similar nature of examination questions across different subjects in China, which is detrimental to stability and unity. If attending prestigious schools is a requirement, then going abroad after high school graduation has far more advantages than going after undergraduate studies. It becomes a class-based filtering process, leading to the same destination through different paths.

Both of these scenarios involve individuals, each operating under a different moral framework, which is gradually deconstructed and distorted when translated into executable actions. Throughout this process, their own judgment is constantly outsourced. Outsourcing itself is not a problem, as division of labor is both a reflection of societal development and an important driving force. However, let's take an airplane as an example. Safely delivering passengers to their destinations requires coordination and trust between the crew and ground staff, but the safe arrival ultimately has objective standards. In the education and research system, the outcomes of its own cultivation are digested by itself. The selection process inherently involves the phenomenon of athletes acting as both players and referees. Some of the selected individuals may not be competent, while some of the non-selected ones may be capable. In that case, it would be straightforward: allocate all resources to the winners and cut off the paths for the losers...

Both models, in their mediocrity, peck at each other, and neither can replace the other. Ultimately, today's physics itself is lackluster. Leaving aside the magnificent breakthroughs during the birth of quantum mechanics and relativity, even the process of constructing the standard model was full of ad hoc solutions. Today, it is difficult to hope for its complete reversal. How much of the knowledge you solidly understand can be applied in your actual research? How many valuable works have you produced over these years of early involvement in research? Young people consider matters they believe are crucial to their future and destiny, but it is nothing more than a few bytes in their boss's email inbox. Whether they accept you or someone else, the difference is insignificant.

In short, there are no heroes in our time, which allows mediocre individuals to gain fame.

In the afternoon, a lady who had a conversation with "群发哥" (a nickname) the day before gave a speech shortly after him. Looking at her organization on the first page of the presentation slides, it seemed that she was a junior colleague in his doctoral laboratory and was about to join his current research institute. ~~In other words, she is the enemy who took away my offer~~. So, I posted a complaint in my friend circle. Her speech exceeded the allotted time and was interrupted by the host. I was about to

 add a comment saying "Exceeded the time, so bad," but considering that I had been posting quite a lot on my friend circle in the past few days, I refrained.

The only person I admired during my four years in university, "峰神" (a nickname), replied below, saying he had also considered applying to the same research institute. I asked him where he is now, and a few minutes later, I saw his reply: "Already started working." I quickly teased him, saying "Rich brother, lend me 50 yuan." However, the words spoken at the meeting reverberated in my mind, sighing and turning into a deep breath. I silently put away my phone.

## Quantitative cell physiology I - shape and size

missed 1st talk for breakfast.

### Beyond G1/S regulation: how cell size homeostasis is tightly controlled throughout the cell cycle?

G1/S not the main control cell size variation; CV reduces across cell cycle

rate positively correlated to size, but not exponential. this should lead to different mass density, but it is maintained tightly stable.

### Cell cycle dependent growth regulation in bacteria.

data  show that E. Coli cell growth is super-exponential.

model: ribonsome growth is exponential, 

B. Subtilis growth rate is not monotonic

Scott, M, 2014 Mol Sys Bio

tome averaged mass function and allocation function are equivalent.

A model, but didn’t see how it’s correlated to cell-cycle

### E. Coli coordination of cell dimensions to preserve macromolecular densities between compartments

shape is also important, not just dimensions. 

periplasm is the region between inner and outer membrane of E. Coli. Its colume fraction scales differently with the width and length of the cell

measure periplasm density by shocking and destroying the outer membrane and measure protein amount

cell aspect ratio is relatively controlled by changing periplasm biomass fraction and average cell width. Testified in multiple mutants

Growth rate is not a control parameter

### Molecular noise on cellular growth

standard model of size homeostasis: timer, adder, sizer

consider noise, get lower bound of size

mechanical factors give same-fitness cells different growth rates in a colony. cells labels with 2 colors of fluorescence and grow in a mixed colony

mechanical forces slows down natural selection, both directions

used yeasts and grow for 10 days. select edge and center and continue growing. center still similar, but edge cells become elongated. “The elongation is a mechanism to get out of nitrogen starvation”(?)

sequenced ancester, center, and edge cells. Found 9 genes

> ChatGPT:
> 
> In biology, a matrix refers to a non-living or extracellular substance that provides structural support or serves as a medium for cellular interactions. The matrix can be made up of various components such as proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals, and it can be found in different biological contexts, such as bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix surrounding cells.
> 
> For example, in bone tissue, the extracellular matrix provides support and rigidity to the bone and is primarily composed of collagen fibers and mineralized calcium phosphate. In cartilage, the matrix is composed of collagen and proteoglycans and serves as a cushion between bones in joints. In connective tissue, the matrix provides support and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between cells.

The study uses an active **vertex model** to demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for distinct rotational dynamics. The study also investigates the emergence of chiral symmetry breaking in multicellular systems using experiments and simulations of rotating pancreas spheres. The authors propose that topological defects in the polarity field underlie the symmetry breaking. The article discusses the role of geometry in the behavior and properties of epithelial tissues, including cell division, patterning, and left-right symmetry breaking.

            <description><![CDATA[Really, what are Python's interpreter, editor, and virtual environment]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[

In the previous post "[Configuring Python Development Environment on Windows 10](python-installation-and-configuration)", I did roughly three things:
- First, I installed the Python interpreter.
- Second, I installed VSCode on the computer.
- Third, as we know, is the virtual environment, virtualenv.

If there's something else worth mentioning, it's to add a bit of "what" alongside the "how". To make the article flow better, I plan to rearrange the order: first, talk about the editor, then the interpreter, and finally, the virtual environment. Although the article is based on Python, these concepts apply to almost all general-purpose programming languages. Because I'm not from a computer science background, this article is just my study notes, so if there are any inaccuracies, feel free to point them out.

## Editor

First, let's do an experiment. Rename the Python file `hello.py` created in the previous tutorial, change the extension `.py` to `.txt`, then double-click to open the file. What happens? In the Windows system, the most ordinary Notepad window pops up, displaying Python statements in black text on a white background, unlike in VSCode where different statements have different colors, but the content is exactly the same.

Furthermore, you can directly execute the content of a `.txt` file in the command line with the Python interpreter (`py -m hello.txt`), with the same effect as `.py`.

The `.py` extension doesn't do anything special; like a `.txt` file, its content is simply a string of characters readable by humans. Such files are called [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file). An editor is a program that handles text files. Notepad is one type of editor, as is VSCode.

Since Notepad can already write Python code, why bother installing VSCode? Indeed, some people really only use Notepad or other built-in editors of the operating system to write Python code (there's even a video on YouTube of someone writing code in Microsoft Word); then debug the program using the command line. However, VSCode is specifically developed for programmers, providing many features that default editors lack, such as syntax highlighting, which highlights functions, variables, and keywords in different colors.

## Compiler / Interpreter

In addition to text files, the second type of file mentioned in this article is a [binary file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file).

Computers cannot directly understand characters recognized by humans. At the lowest level, classic computers understand only 0s and 1s represented in different ways. Although all files are ultimately binary at the lowest level, the term "binary file" is generally used specifically to refer to files other than text files. Since image files, video files, etc., have their own names, the files referred to by this term are basically related to software programs, files that can be executed by computers.

Humans recognize characters, computers recognize only 0s and 1s, so the most intuitive approach is to translate text files into binary files. This translation process is called [compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), and the software that can accomplish this is called a compiler. Once compilation is complete, the compiler exits, and to execute the program, the computer simply executes the compiled executable file.

However, compilation has a problem: the entire software needs to be compiled into a complete executable with all source code text files written. As the scale of the software grows, the resources and time required for compilation increase; once a modification is made, the entire project needs to be recompiled. Many times, we only want to quickly know the effect of a command in a large project; compilation is not suitable for such scenarios.

Thus, the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) emerged. This type of program is much more complex than a compiler. It runs whenever we execute a command in a programming language, allowing us to enter commands one by one, remembering the context of the code, and even remembering the results of our previous commands. The cost is that even for large projects, it needs to analyze and interpret line by line, and its computational resource overhead and speed are not as efficient as compilation.

Python is a (official implementation) programming language that uses an interpreter. The `python-***.exe` file we download from the official website is the Python interpreter. This also means that Python programs tend to perform less well than programs written by C/C++ programmers of the same level. However, due to its suitability for trial and error with single-line execution, Python is quite popular in research fields.

Of course, Python's characteristics are far more than just being an interpreted language. It is also:

- [Dynamic language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-choose-python-2-dynamic.html)
- [Object-oriented language](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-choose-python-3-oop.html)

## Virtual Environment

Once I asked my girlfriend what IDE she uses to write Python, and she proudly replied that her MacBook comes with Python, so she can run it directly from the command line... The problem wasn't that she didn't answer my question directly (actually, thinking about it, she did answer part of the question), but rather that running the system's built-in Python interpreter or other programming language interpreters or compilers directly from the command line is a dangerous practice common among beginner programmers.

Fortunately, Windows is fine; after all, it's an operating system aimed at the general consumer, so it doesn't come with Python pre-installed. However, for more geek-oriented operating systems like Linux and the BSD family, things are different. These operating systems (or their distributions) often come pre-installed with Python. This Python isn't intended for users to develop their own programs but rather for the many system tools written in Python to call upon. Since the version of Python is usually controlled by the package manager of the distribution, it often lags behind the latest Python version for some time to avoid bugs in the new version and to give developers of system tools time to update their code. So, if you use this version of Python for development and accidentally upgrade Python, it's likely to cause some system functionality to malfunction.

A virtual environment is Python's solution to this problem. We can install a version of Python different from the system's default version but not add this interpreter to the system path, so the operating system is unaware of the existence of this version of Python. When creating a virtual environment, we specify the use of this specific version of Python. So, after activating the virtual environment, it becomes the Python we need for development, and exiting the virtual environment returns to the Python used by system tools.

Moreover, even if two projects use the same version of Python and both use the system's default version, virtual environments still have a place. Most programs require dependency onlibrary code written by others, called libraries. Different projects may depend on different library code, or different versions of the same library. In this case, you can create separate virtual environments and install the libraries corresponding to each project. Projects can be isolated from each other.

## Editor + Interpreter / Compiler + Virtual Environment Management + ... = IDE

It's too cumbersome to install so many different programs for Python development. Can't it be done with just one click? Of course it can. A program that integrates various tools used in the development process is called an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). For Python, the most famous IDE is undoubtedly [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Then why don't I use it? Of course, I've used it before, but after hearing about the fame of VSCode and trying it out, I don't want to go back. Writing Python requires editing `.py` files, writing blog posts requires editing `.md` files, and some blog features require JavaScript. Essentially, all these tasks involve editing text files. In an editor like VSCode, everything is done together. So, programs like Spyder and Jupyter Lab in Anaconda seem redundant.

"Doing one thing well" is also part of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). But the problem is that different people have different definitions of "one thing". Some people think making breakfast is one thing, while others think it involves several things like heating milk, frying eggs, and toasting bread. Who is right?

Perhaps both are right, but Editor + Interpreter + ... is upstream on the chain of contempt compared to IDE. You may disagree with this, but you should know it; otherwise, when others show off, you might feel embarrassed for not being prepared.

> 第十讲是由校外邀请来的嘉宾来讲数据降维，所以课程网站上没有课件。时间轴和语音转录相对来说不那么有意义了。所以在听课的过程中做了如下笔记。

## Contents

- High dimensinoal data
- Dimensionality Reduction Methods
- Clustering (a discrete form of reduction)

## High Dimensional Data

data matrix X:n*m. 

n samples as rows, m columns as observables

How to visualize?
- m=1: list
- m=2: x-y plot

__Aim of dimension reduction: reduce the number of observables, while keeping relevant information.__

### Examples

Ferromagnetic Ising model of a 28*28 lattice, 50,000 samples. The 1st principal component scales with the magnetization. 

500,000 DNA sites of 3,000 humans. Projections onto the first 2 principal components givees a rough map of Europe

Fashion MNIST: 60,000 pictures of 784 (28*28) pixels. UMAP projections onto 2 dimensions 

## Linear dimension reduction

- Principal component analysis
- Non-negative matrix factorization
- Independent component analysis
- Factor analysis

### Principal component analysis

change of basis

__Aim:__ to find a transformation such that
- the components are uncorrelated
- ordered by the explained variability

__Math__:

$$ X^T X $$ is a $$m \times m$$ matrix. Eigen-decomposition gives $$(\lambda,W) $$ where $$W$$'s columns are eigen vectors sorted by $$\lambda$$

$$ T = X \cdot W $$ where  $$T$$ is the score onto principal components, and $$T^TT$$ is diagonal

$$ T_r = X \cdot W_r $$ where $$W_r$$ is a n*r matrix of the first r components

__Practice In `R`__: 

- Iris Dataset
- Pitures of Objects at Different Angles: 
- Swiss Roll: the transformed data almost have the same structure as the original data. This shows the limit of PCA due to linearity

[wikipedia - Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction]()

### UMAP: uniform manifold approximation

__Assumptions__:
- uniformed distributeed on Riemann manifold
- Riemann metric is locally constant
- The manifold is locally conncected

__Results__:
- models the manifold with a fuzzy topological structure
- finds low dimensional projection of the data that has the cloest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure 

__Simplex__
0-simplex: dot
1-simplex: line
2-simplex: triangle
3-simplex: 正四面体

__Problem__:

When the uniform distribution is not met, the result may not be what we like. To circumvent this, we need to define the local metric with the nearest neighbours.

__Finding a low dimensional representation__
- derive similar fuzzy topological representation of a low dimensional representation
- interpret edge weight s as proba
- minimize cross entropy
- [pair-code.github.io/understand_umap](pair-code.github.com/understand_umap)

__Practice in `R`__
- Swiss Roll becomes a 2-d ring
- Pictures at different angles are well seperated

## Clustering

### hierarchiral clustering
- metric
- linkage criterion / distance between clusters

### centroid base clustering (k-means)
- pre-specify number of clusters, k
- partition the data such that the squared distance to cluster mean position is minimal
- Lloyd algorithm
    - start with random centers
    - assign data to neatest center
    - compute new centers

### graph based-clustering
- graph representation of data
- partition the data such that modularity Q is optimized
- $$ Q = \sum_{i=1}^c e_{ii}-\gamma {a_i}^2, a_i = \sum_{j-1}^c e_{ij} $$.
    - $$ e_{ij} $$: fraction of links between cluster i and j
    - $$ \gamma $$: resulution

## Summary

Question: How to identify order in high-dimensinoal data?
- dimensionality reductuon to visualize high-dimensional data and to identify macroscopic observables
- clustering to identify discrete order in high dimensional data
- methods to se depending on the problem at hand

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
My Python version has been stuck at 3.7 for a while, but now the latest version is already at 3.9. Recently, I needed to study a piece of Python code written by someone else, who specifically requested Python version 3.6. So, I uninstalled the 3.7 version and reinstalled both Python versions 3.9 and 3.6.

I've been trying to encourage my parents to learn programming for a long time, and I owe them a tutorial. Whether it's for those who are committed to continuous improvement in their first programming language or for those who intend to dabble lightly in programming, Python is an excellent choice. So, even though my parents have no interest in programming whatsoever, I still completed this tutorial, hoping it could help others. Since it's aimed at complete beginners, it's based on the Windows 10 operating system. And because I also use this setup myself, based on personal preference, I didn't directly use `conda`.

## Let's go

### Download `python` interpreter from the official website

Download from the official website of Python ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-official-website.png)

### Install `python` interpreter

After executing the downloaded file, you'll see the interface as shown in the screenshot below. Click on the option highlighted in red box because I want to change the installation path. It seems that you can also check the "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" at the bottom. I didn't select it during installation, but later I found out that this step needs to be done manually.

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-install.png)

Following that, check each option in the next interface, then click "Next".

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-next.png)

In the upcoming interface, select "Install for all users" and then choose an installation path you prefer. The reason I choose C:\Python39 for this location is because:

1. The C drive is the system drive and it's a solid-state drive on my machine, which is faster.
2. The default path is in the personal folder, which is quite hard to find.
3. `C:\Program Files` requires administrator permissions, which is inconvenient for using pip for package management.

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-python-install-path.png)

After the installation is complete, open the command prompt and type `py`. You should see a string of Python version information, and then the command prompt will change to `>>>`, indicating that you have entered the Python environment, where you can execute Python commands line by line. Type `exit()` to exit Python.

### Set environment variable

In the Windows search bar, type "environment variables," and before you finish typing, you should see the suggested result as shown in the image below:

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-search.png)

Then, follow the steps in the image below to complete two tasks:
1. Add two new values, `C:\Python39` and `C:\Python39\Scripts`, to the `Path` variable.
2. Create a new folder for storing Python virtual environments (such as `C:\PythonEnvs`). Create a new variable named `WORKON_HOME` and set its value to `C:\PythonEnvs`.

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-environment-variable-box.png)

### Install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`

Following the steps just now, `pip` should now be installed. You should see similar feedback in the command line after entering the commands along the way:

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-pip-check.png)

If the command line indicates that `pip` is not found, you may need to reinstall it using the method outlined in [this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py).

Type `py -m pip install virtualenv` in the command line to install the virtual environment manager:

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenv-install.png)

After a successful installation message appears, type `py -m pip install virtualenvwrapper-win` in the command line. The result should be similar to the image above; I forgot to take a screenshot.

### Create a virtual env, and install `jupyter`

After installing `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`, enter `mkvirtualenv base` in the command line to create a new virtual environment named base.

Then enter `workon base`. At this point, you should see `(base)` at the beginning of the command prompt, indicating that we are now working within the base virtual environment. Now, when you check `pip --version`, you'll notice that the Python location has changed from before.

![Example Image](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-virtualenvwrapper-check.png)

Within this environment, install Jupyter by typing `pip install jupyter`. While this step is not mandatory, it allows us to have a similar experience to Spyder, which comes with Conda, once we install VSCode. This makes it very convenient for beginners to debug line by line.

### Download and install `vscode`

Download the installation package from the official website of VS Code ([link here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), where you'll find a prominent download button:

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-download.png)

After downloading, the installation process is similar to that of any other program (it's been a while, so no screenshots).

Once installed, open the program and click on the icon outlined in red on the left toolbar, then search for Python-related VS Code plugins. For Python development, you generally need `python`, `pylance`, and `jupyter`:

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-plugin.png)

In the future, when you want to run VS Code, right-click in the folder where you want to start coding and select "Open with Code":

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-folder-open.png)

Next, in the VS Code interface, click on the button outlined in red in the file tree to create a new file, name it `*.py`, and here I just wrote something like "hello."

![](/blog/photos/2021-03-07-vscode-new-file.png)
